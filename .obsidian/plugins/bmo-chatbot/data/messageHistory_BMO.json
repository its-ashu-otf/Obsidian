Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.\n2. Integrity: Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and not modified by unauthorized parties.\n3. Availability: Making sure that data and systems are accessible when needed.\n\nInformation Security involves a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to safeguard an organization's digital assets, which includes:\n\n* Networks\n* Systems\n* Data\n* Applications\n* People\n\nThe primary goal of Information Security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, as well as protecting it from cyber threats and risks.\n\n(Source: EC-Council CEH v12 study materials)",

        "content": "In the context of Information Security, Authenticity and Non-Repudiation are two related concepts that ensure the legitimacy and trustworthiness of electronic messages or transactions.\n\n**Authenticity:**\n\nAuthenticity refers to the assurance that a message or data comes from a specific sender and has not been tampered with during transmission. In other words, it ensures that the sender is who they claim to be and that the message is genuine. Authenticity involves verifying the identity of the sender and ensuring that the message has not been altered in any way.\n\n**Non-Repudiation:**\n\nNon-Repudiation is a related concept that provides assurance that a sender cannot deny sending a message or data. In other words, once a message is sent, the sender cannot claim that they did not send it. Non-Repudiation ensures that the sender is accountable for their actions and that they cannot later deny responsibility.\n\nTogether, Authenticity and Non-Repudiation provide a robust mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness of electronic messages or transactions. They are essential in many areas, such as:\n\n1. Electronic commerce: Ensuring that customers receive accurate information and can trust the authenticity of online transactions.\n2. Email communication: Verifying the identity of senders and preventing spoofing or phishing attacks.\n3. Digital signatures: Authenticating the sender's identity and ensuring that messages are not tampered with during transmission.\n\nIn technical terms, Non-Repudiation is often achieved using digital signatures, which combine the concepts of authenticity and integrity to ensure that:\n\n1. The message comes from a specific sender (authenticity).\n2. The message has not been altered in any way (integrity).\n\nBy combining Authenticity and Non-Repudiation, we can create trustful electronic interactions that are resistant to tampering or denial.",
