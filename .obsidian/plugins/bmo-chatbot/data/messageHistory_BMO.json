        "content": "A DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phonebook for the internet. It helps you find websites and online services by matching their human-readable domain names to their numerical IP addresses.\n\nThink of it this way: when you want to visit a website, you typically type in its domain name (like \"www.example.com\") rather than its IP address (a series of numbers like \"93.184.216.34\"). The DNS system translates that domain name into the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the correct server and display the website.\n\nFor example:\n\n* You type in \"www.google.com\" in your browser.\n* The DNS system looks up the IP address associated with \"www.google.com\".\n* It finds the IP address \"173.194.222.104\" and returns it to your browser.\n* Your browser uses that IP address to connect to Google's servers, and you see the website.\n\nWithout a DNS system, you'd need to know the exact IP address of every website you want to visit, which would be very cumbersome! The DNS makes it easy for humans to access websites using simple domain names.",
