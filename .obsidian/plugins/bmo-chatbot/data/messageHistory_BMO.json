        "content": "**Decision Control Statements in Python**\n\nDecision control statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to take different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n\n### 1. **if Statement**\n\nThe `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed.\n\n**Syntax:** `if (condition):`\n```python\nx = 5\nif x > 10:\n    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n```\n\n### 2. **if-else Statement**\n\nThe `if-else` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code within the `else` block is executed.\n\n**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something else:`\n```python\nx = 5\nif x > 10:\n    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 10\")\n```\n\n### 3. **if-elif-else Statement**\n\nThe `if-elif-else` statement is used to check multiple conditions in sequence.\n\n**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something elif (another condition): # do another thing else:`\n```python\nx = 5\nif x > 10:\n    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\nelif x == 5:\n    print(\"x is equal to 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 4\")\n```\n\nThese decision control statements provide a simple way to make decisions in Python programs, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific conditions.",

        "content": "**Iterative/Loop Statements in Python**\n\nIterative/loop statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.\n\n### 1. **while Loop**\n\nThe `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it's false, the loop terminates.\n\n**Syntax:** `while (condition):`\n```python\nx = 0\nwhile x < 5:\n    print(x)\n    x += 1\n```\n\n### 2. **for Loop**\n\nThe `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list or a string.\n\n**Syntax:** `for (variable) in (sequence):`\n```python\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\n\n### Characteristics of Loops:\n\n* **Repeatability**: Loops allow you to execute code multiple times.\n* **Condition-based termination**: Loops can be terminated based on a specific condition.\n\n### Types of Loops:\n\n* **Infinite Loop**: A loop that runs indefinitely, without any termination condition. (Example: `while True:`)\n* **Finite Loop**: A loop that runs for a specified number of iterations or until a certain condition is met.\n* **Indexed Loop**: A loop that iterates over an indexed collection, such as a list or array.\n\n**Loop Control Statements**\n\nIn addition to the `break` statement (used to exit a loop prematurely), Python also supports:\n\n* **continue**: Used to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one.\n* **pass**: A placeholder statement that can be used when no action is required in a specific case.\n\nBy using these iterative/loop statements, you can write efficient and readable code that repeats tasks or executes blocks of code based on specific conditions.",
