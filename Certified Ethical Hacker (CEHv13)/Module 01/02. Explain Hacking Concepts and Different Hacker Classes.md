## Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
![[Pasted image 20241121214409.png]]

The **Cyber Kill Chain Methodology**—a step-by-step framework used to understand and prevent cyber intrusion activities. 
The Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by **Lockheed Martin** (2022), explains how attackers move through networks to identify vulnerabilities that they can then exploit. Attackers use the steps in the Cyber Kill Chain when conducting offensive operations in cyberspace against their targets. If you’re responsible for defending a network, this model can help you understand the stages of a cyberattack and the measures you can take to prevent or intercept each step.

---

### 1. **Reconnaissance**

**Definition**: Gathering information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities.

- **Techniques**:
    - **Passive Reconnaissance**: Using tools like _Shodan_, _Google Dorking_, or social media to collect publicly available information.
    - **Active Reconnaissance**: Scanning the network with tools like _Nmap_ to find open ports or services.
- **Examples**:
    - Identifying a company’s domain and subdomains using _Sublist3r_.
    - Collecting employee details via LinkedIn to craft phishing emails.

---

### 2. **Weaponization**

**Definition**: Creating a malicious payload, such as a backdoor or malware, designed to exploit a target's vulnerability.

- **Techniques**:
    - Using frameworks like _Metasploit_ to craft malicious exploits.
    - Embedding malware in seemingly legitimate documents or applications using tools like _MSFVenom_.
- **Examples**:
    - Crafting a malicious PDF that exploits an Adobe Reader vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2019-14586).
    - Creating a trojanized Excel file with embedded macros to execute a reverse shell.

---

### 3. **Delivery**
