## Information Assurance (IA) Simplified

- IA refers to the assurance that the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of information and information systems is protected during the usage, processing, storage, and transmission of information
- Some of the processes that help in achieving information assurance include:
	1. Developing local policy, process, and guidance
	2. Designing network and user authentication strategies
	3. Identifying network vulnerabilities and threats
	4. Identifying problem and resource requirements
	5. Creating plans for identified resource requirements
	6. Applying appropriate information assurance controls
	7. Performing certification and accreditation
	8. Providing information assurance training

**Processes for Achieving Information Assurance**

Information assurance ensures the protection and reliability of information systems by implementing various security measures. Some essential processes to achieve information assurance include:

1. **Developing Local Policies and Guidance**
    - Establishing policies to maintain security at an optimal level.
2. **Designing Network and User Authentication Strategy**
    - Ensuring secure network design to protect user data.
    - Implementing authentication mechanisms to secure access.
3. **Identifying Network Vulnerabilities and Threats**
    - Conducting vulnerability assessments to evaluate security posture.
    - Identifying potential threats and implementing necessary countermeasures.
4. **Identifying Problems and Resource Requirements**
    - Recognizing security gaps and necessary resources to address them.
5. **Creating a Plan for Resource Requirements**
    - Developing a structured approach to implement security enhancements.
6. **Applying Appropriate Information Assurance Controls**
    - Implementing security controls to safeguard data and systems.
7. **Performing Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Process**
    - Conducting security evaluations to detect vulnerabilities.
    - Implementing corrective measures to mitigate risks.
8. **Providing Information Assurance Training**
    - Educating personnel on security best practices in both federal and private sectors.
    - Raising awareness about cybersecurity threats and protective measures.

By following these processes, organizations can maintain robust information security, reduce vulnerabilities, and enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.

## Continua 1/ Adaptive Security <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Strategy</span>
- Organizations should adopt adaptive security strategy, which involves implementing all the four network security approaches
- The adaptive security strategy consists of four security activities corresponding to each security approach

An adaptive security strategy ensures comprehensive network defence by continuously predicting, preventing, detecting, and responding to threats.

1. **Protection**
    - Implementing defence-in-depth strategies to secure endpoints, networks, and data.
    - Utilizing security policies, physical security, host security, firewalls, and IDS to eliminate vulnerabilities.
2. **Detection**
    - Monitoring network traffic for anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and modifications.
    - Using network monitoring and packet sniffing tools for continuous threat detection.
3. **Responding**
    - Identifying security incidents, analysing root causes, and executing mitigation strategies.
    - Implementing incident response measures such as containment, investigation, and eradication.
    - Differentiating between real security incidents and false positives.
4. **Prediction**
    - Identifying potential threats before they materialize into attacks.
    - Conducting risk assessments, attack surface analysis, and leveraging threat intelligence data to predict future threats.

By following these processes, organizations can maintain robust information security, reduce vulnerabilities, and enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.

## Defense-in-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Depth</span> 

- Defense-in-depth is a security strategy in which **several protection layers** are placed throughout an information system.
- It helps to **prevent direct attacks** against the system and its data because a break in one layer only leads the attacker to the next layer

## What is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Risk?</span> 

-  Risk refers to the degree of **uncertainty** or expectation that an adverse event may cause damage to the system
- Risks are categorized into different levels according to their estimated impact on the system
- A risk matrix is used to scale risk by considering the **probability**, **likelihood**, and **consequence** or **impact** of the risk
### **Risk Levels**

| **Risk Level**      | **Action**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extreme or High** | - Immediate measures should be taken to combat risk - Identify and impose controls to reduce risk to a reasonably low level |
| **Medium**          | - No urgent action is required - Implement controls as soon as possible to reduce risk to a reasonably low level            |
| **Low**             | - Take preventive steps to mitigate the effects of risk                                                                     |


### **Risk Matrix**

|**Probability**|**Likelihood**|**Insignificant**|**Minor**|**Moderate**|**Major**|**Severe**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**81 - 100%**|Very High Probability|Low|Medium|High|Extreme|Extreme|
|**61 - 80%**|High Probability|Low|Medium|High|High|Extreme|
|**41 - 60%**|Equal Probability|Low|Medium|Medium|High|High|
|**21 - 40%**|Low Probability|Low|Medium|Medium|Medium|High|
|**1 - 20%**|Very Low Probability|Low|Low|Medium|Medium|High|
