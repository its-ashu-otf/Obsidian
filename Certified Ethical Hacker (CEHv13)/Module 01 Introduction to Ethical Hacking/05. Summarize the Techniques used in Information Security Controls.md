#### **What is Risk?**

Risk refers to the degree of uncertainty or the potential damage an adverse event may cause to a system or its resources. It is defined as:

- The probability of a threat occurring and causing harm.
- The interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and impact on assets.
- A product of the likelihood of an event occurring and its potential impact.

#### **Risk Formula:**

<h4> <center> RISK=Threat×Vulnerability×Impact </center> </h1>


Alternatively, considering asset value:

<h4> <center> RISK=Threat×Vulnerability×Asset  </center> </h1>

#### **Risk Level Assessment**

Risk levels are determined by evaluating both **likelihood** (probability of occurrence) and **consequence** (impact severity). The level of risk is calculated as:

<h4> <center> Level of Risk=Consequence×Likelihood  </center> </h1>

Risk levels are typically categorized into:

- **Extreme:** Requires immediate action to mitigate.
- **High:** Significant risk, needing prompt control measures.
- **Medium:** Manageable risk; controls should be implemented soon.
- **Low:** Minimal risk; preventive measures recommended.

#### **Risk Matrix**

A **risk matrix** visually represents risk severity based on **likelihood** and **consequences**. It helps organizations:

- Assess and compare risks effectively.
- Determine priority levels for mitigation efforts.

## Threat Intelligence <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lifecycle</span> 

![[Pasted image 20250207004503.png]]

The **threat intelligence lifecycle** is a structured and continuous process designed to develop intelligence from raw data, ultimately helping organizations defend against emerging risks and threats. It involves a cycle of five main phases: **planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production**, and **dissemination and integration**. Here’s a breakdown of these phases:

### 1. **Planning and Direction**

- This phase focuses on defining the strategic requirements for developing threat intelligence. It involves setting objectives, identifying key intelligence needs, and determining the best methods for data collection. The process ensures that the intelligence gathered will be relevant and actionable. The planning phase also establishes roles and responsibilities for the intelligence team.

### 2. **Collection**

- In this phase, the actual intelligence is gathered using various methods such as **human intelligence (HUMINT)**, **signal intelligence (SIGINT)**, **imagery intelligence (IMINT)**, and **open-source intelligence (OSINT)**. Depending on the confidentiality of the information, this collection can be direct or covert. The intelligence gathered here is transferred for processing in the next phase.

### 3. **Processing and Exploitation**

- Data collected in the previous phase often comes in raw, unstructured formats. In this phase, the data is processed and transformed into a structured format using advanced tools and techniques, making it ready for analysis. This step may include activities like filtering, parsing, decryption, and data aggregation.

### 4. **Analysis and Production**

- The processed data is analyzed to extract useful and actionable information. This phase involves identifying patterns, estimating potential threats, and predicting future attacks. Analysts apply various reasoning techniques (deductive, inductive, abduction, scientific) to synthesize data into meaningful intelligence. When the analysis provides enough context to identify potential threats, it is considered intelligence, which helps inform countermeasures.

### 5. **Dissemination and Integration**

- The final phase involves distributing the analyzed intelligence to the appropriate stakeholders, ensuring the right people have the information they need to act. This can be done automatically or manually and often includes reports on threat indicators, security alerts, and adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Feedback is gathered from consumers, which informs the next cycle of intelligence production.

This lifecycle is dynamic and cyclical, meaning it continually evolves based on feedback from stakeholders. Each phase of the process is vital in ensuring that an organization remains well-prepared to address emerging cyber threats and risks.

- ML is an **unsupervised self-learning system** that is used to define what the normal network looks like, along with its devices, and then to backtrack and **report any deviations or anomalies** in real-time
- Al and ML in cyber security helps in **identifying new exploits and weaknesses**, which can then be easily analyzed to mitigate further attacks
- ML classification techniques:
	- Supervised learning makes use of algorithms that input a **set of labelled training data**, with the aim of learning the differences between the labels
	- Unsupervised learning makes use of algorithms that input **unlabelled training data**, with the aim of deducing all categories by itself

![[Pasted image 20250207011354.png]]

**Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** are increasingly used across industries due to advancements in computing power, data collection, and storage capabilities. These technologies play a vital role in cybersecurity, helping to identify new exploits, weaknesses, and potential threats. With their ability to analyze vast amounts of data and detect anomalies, AI and ML reduce the burden on security professionals by alerting them when further action is needed.

### What Are AI and ML?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to technology that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks like decision-making, problem-solving, and pattern recognition. AI helps defend networks against a variety of attacks that antivirus scans might miss by analyzing large volumes of collected data to identify trends and patterns, which can be used to detect new threats.
    
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of AI that enables systems to self-learn from data without explicit programming. ML helps to understand what a "normal" network environment looks like (including its devices and activity) and can then identify deviations or anomalies in real-time, alerting security teams to potential threats.
    

### Types of ML Classification Techniques

1. **Supervised Learning**  
    Supervised learning uses algorithms that learn from labelled training data. This helps the system understand the differences between data categories. Supervised learning is further divided into:
    
    - **Classification**: It categorizes data into distinct classes or groups. For example, it may classify network traffic as either benign or malicious.
    - **Regression**: It deals with continuous data, predicting values rather than assigning categories. It’s used when data classes are not distinctly separated.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
    In unsupervised learning, algorithms work with unlabelled data, attempting to deduce patterns and groupings without explicit guidance. It is divided into:
    
    - **Clustering**: It groups data into clusters based on similarities without knowing predefined classes. This is useful in identifying hidden patterns, such as detecting new types of cyberattacks based on behavior similarities.
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: This process reduces the number of features (or dimensions) in data while retaining important information. It helps make the data easier to analyze and can reveal previously unnoticed anomalies.

By leveraging AI and ML, organizations can significantly enhance their ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats, providing more efficient security defenses and reducing reliance on manual intervention.
