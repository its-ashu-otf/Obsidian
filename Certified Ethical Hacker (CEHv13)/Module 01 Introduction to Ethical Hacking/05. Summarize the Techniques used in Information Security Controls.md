#### **What is Risk?**

Risk refers to the degree of uncertainty or the potential damage an adverse event may cause to a system or its resources. It is defined as:

- The probability of a threat occurring and causing harm.
- The interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and impact on assets.
- A product of the likelihood of an event occurring and its potential impact.

#### **Risk Formula:**

<h4> <center> RISK=Threat×Vulnerability×Impact </center> </h1>


Alternatively, considering asset value:

<h4> <center> RISK=Threat×Vulnerability×Asset  </center> </h1>

#### **Risk Level Assessment**

Risk levels are determined by evaluating both **likelihood** (probability of occurrence) and **consequence** (impact severity). The level of risk is calculated as:

<h4> <center> Level of Risk=Consequence×Likelihood  </center> </h1>

Risk levels are typically categorized into:

- **Extreme:** Requires immediate action to mitigate.
- **High:** Significant risk, needing prompt control measures.
- **Medium:** Manageable risk; controls should be implemented soon.
- **Low:** Minimal risk; preventive measures recommended.

#### **Risk Matrix**

A **risk matrix** visually represents risk severity based on **likelihood** and **consequences**. It helps organizations:

- Assess and compare risks effectively.
- Determine priority levels for mitigation efforts.
- Support decision-making for cybersecurity measures.

Organizations should create their own risk matrices based on specific business needs, ensuring effective risk management and mitigation strategies.

## Threat Intelligence <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lifecycle</span> 

![[Pasted image 20250207004503.png]]

The **threat intelligence lifecycle** is a structured and continuous process designed to develop intelligence from raw data, ultimately helping organizations defend against emerging risks and threats. It involves a cycle of five main phases: **planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production**, and **dissemination and integration**. Here’s a breakdown of these phases:

### 1. **Planning and Direction**

- This phase focuses on defining the strategic requirements for developing threat intelligence. It involves setting objectives, identifying key intelligence needs, and determining the best methods for data collection. The process ensures that the intelligence gathered will be relevant and actionable. The planning phase also establishes roles and responsibilities for the intelligence team.

### 2. **Collection**

- In this phase, the actual intelligence is gathered using various methods such as **human intelligence (HUMINT)**, **signal intelligence (SIGINT)**, **imagery intelligence (IMINT)**, and **open-source intelligence (OSINT)**. Depending on the confidentiality of the information, this collection can be direct or covert. The intelligence gathered here is transferred for processing in the next phase.

### 3. **Processing and Exploitation**

- Data collected in the previous phase often comes in raw, unstructured formats. In this phase, the data is processed and transformed into a structured format using advanced tools and techniques, making it ready for analysis. This step may include activities like filtering, parsing, decryption, and data aggregation.

### 4. **Analysis and Production**

- The processed data is analyzed to extract useful and actionable information. This phase involves identifying patterns, estimating potential threats, and predicting future attacks. Analysts apply various reasoning techniques (deductive, inductive, abduction, scientific) to synthesize data into meaningful intelligence. When the analysis provides enough context to identify potential threats, it is considered intelligence, which helps inform countermeasures.

### 5. **Dissemination and Integration**

- The final phase involves distributing the analyzed intelligence to the appropriate stakeholders, ensuring the right people have the information they need to act. This can be done automatically or manually and often includes reports on threat indicators, security alerts, and adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Feedback is gathered from consumers, which informs the next cycle of intelligence production.

This lifecycle is dynamic and cyclical, meaning it continually evolves based on feedback from stakeholders. Each phase of the process is vital in ensuring that an organization remains well-prepared to address emerging cyber threats and risks.

    - Identify components, data flows, and trust boundaries.
    - Create a deployment diagram, considering:
        - Topology, logical layers, key components, services, protocols, and dependencies.
    - Define roles and permissions (e.g., who can read, update, or delete data).
3. **Decompose the Application:**
    
    - Break down the application to understand trust boundaries, data flows, and entry/exit points.
    - Identify:
        - **Trust Boundaries:** Areas where trust levels change.
        - **Data Flows:** Input/output data and its validation.
        - **Entry Points:** Areas where users interact with the application.
        - **Exit Points:** Where data is transferred outside the application.
4. **Identify Threats:**
    
    - Identify threats based on the context using a question-driven approach, leveraging the information from the previous steps.
    - Involve development and test teams to uncover potential threats by reviewing common vulnerability categories.
5. **Identify Vulnerabilities:**
    
    - Discover weaknesses in the application that could be exploited by attackers.
    - Use vulnerability categories to identify and fix weaknesses to prevent exploitation.
