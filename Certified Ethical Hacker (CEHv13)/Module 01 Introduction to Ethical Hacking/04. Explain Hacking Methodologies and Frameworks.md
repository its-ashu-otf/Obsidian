The **CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)**, focusing on the stages of ethical hacking. 

---
The CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) framework outlines the various phases involved in hacking. Here's a breakdown of the key phases:

1. **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**  
    This is the preparatory phase where attackers gather as much information as possible about the target. The goal is to create a profile of the target organization, including details like IP address range, network infrastructure, and employee information. This phase can be divided into two types:
    
    - **Passive Reconnaissance**: The attacker does not interact directly with the target. Instead, they gather information from publicly available sources (e.g., websites, news releases, Whois queries).
    - **Active Reconnaissance**: The attacker interacts directly with the target system to detect open ports, hosts, operating systems, and applications.
2. **Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning**  
    In this phase, attackers scan the target network to identify security vulnerabilities. The goal is to assess the target’s systems and identify weaknesses that could be exploited in further attacks. Vulnerabilities are categorized, and the information gathered is used to perform additional exploitation.
    
3. **Phase 3: Gaining Access**  
    After identifying vulnerabilities, attackers attempt to gain access to the target system. This could involve exploiting weaknesses such as buffer overflows, password cracking, or other vulnerabilities in the system. Once access is gained, the attacker often escalates their privileges to gain full control over the system.
    
    - **Escalating Privileges**: Once an attacker gains access with a low-privilege account, they may attempt to increase their access level to an administrator or root level, which allows them to perform protected operations and further exploit the system.
4. **Phase 4: Maintaining Access**  
    Once an attacker has gained control of a system, they work to maintain access to the system. This may involve installing backdoors, using rootkits, or other methods to keep control over the system. The attacker may also use this system as a launchpad for further attacks on other systems.
    
5. **Phase 5: Clearing Tracks**  
    To avoid detection, attackers will attempt to erase evidence of their activities. This could involve deleting logs or modifying system configurations to hide their presence on the system. This phase is crucial for maintaining stealth and preventing the target organization from discovering the breach.
    

Each phase plays a crucial role in a hacker's attempt to compromise a system, and understanding these phases helps ethical hackers identify vulnerabilities and defend against such attacks.

## Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
![[Pasted image 20241121214409.png]]

The **Cyber Kill Chain Methodology**—a step-by-step framework used to understand and prevent cyber intrusion activities. 
The Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by **Lockheed Martin** (2022), explains how attackers move through networks to identify vulnerabilities that they can then exploit. Attackers use the steps in the Cyber Kill Chain when conducting offensive operations in cyberspace against their targets. If you’re responsible for defending a network, this model can help you understand the stages of a cyberattack and the measures you can take to prevent or intercept each step.

---

---

The Cyber Kill Chain helps security professionals analyse, prevent, and respond to attacks effectively.

## Adversary behavioral identification

Adversary behavioral identification helps security professionals detect potential attacks by identifying common methods and techniques used by attackers. Here's a breakdown of the behaviors described and how they can be identified or mitigated:

### 1. **Internal Reconnaissance**

**Description**: After gaining access to a network, adversaries perform internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network, systems, and processes. They look for details such as system configurations, user context, host names, IP addresses, and active systems.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Monitoring unusual or suspicious commands in **Batch scripts** or **PowerShell**.
    - Using **packet capturing tools** (e.g., Wireshark) to monitor traffic for signs of reconnaissance.
    - Checking **Windows Event Logs** and other system logs for unfamiliar activity.

### 2. **Use of PowerShell**

**Description**: PowerShell is often used by attackers to automate tasks such as data exfiltration and launching further attacks. PowerShell's powerful capabilities make it a prime tool for attackers, but it can also be monitored for misuse.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Reviewing **PowerShell transcript logs** and **Windows Event Logs** for suspicious commands.
    - Monitoring user-agent strings and IP addresses to spot malicious hosts involved in data exfiltration.

### 3. **Unspecified Proxy Activities**

**Description**: Attackers may set up multiple domains pointing to the same host to bypass detection and switch between domains. This helps them evade tracking and detection mechanisms.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Analyzing **data feeds** from domains to identify suspicious activities, including communication with unknown or malicious external networks.
    - Monitoring logs for anomalous **DNS traffic** or suspicious downloads related to proxy activities.

### 4. **Use of Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

**Description**: Adversaries use the command-line interface to interact with the target system, execute malicious commands, read or modify files, install malware, or create new user accounts.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Monitoring **process IDs** for unusual activities or processes with random or arbitrary names.
    - Checking **logs** for unusual commands executed via CLI or unusual file downloads.

### 5. **HTTP User Agent**

**Description**: Attackers often modify the **HTTP user agent** field to disguise their malicious activities or to communicate with compromised systems.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Monitoring **HTTP request headers** for suspicious or modified user agent strings.
    - Correlating the modified user agent with known attack patterns or malicious traffic.

### 6. **Command and Control Server**

**Description**: Attackers use command and control (C2) servers to remotely control compromised systems. The communication between the attacker and the compromised system is often encrypted, making it harder to detect.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Tracking **network traffic** for unusual outbound connections to external hosts.
    - Monitoring **open ports**, especially those that are unusual or unnecessary.
    - Looking for **anomalies** in network traffic, such as encrypted communications with suspicious destinations.

### 7. **Use of DNS Tunneling**

**Description**: DNS tunneling allows adversaries to hide malicious traffic within normal DNS requests. This can be used to bypass security controls and to communicate with a C2 server or exfiltrate data.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Analyzing **DNS traffic** for unusual patterns, such as long or encrypted DNS requests.
    - Identifying **unspecified domains** in DNS queries.
    - Inspecting the **payloads** of DNS requests for unusual or obfuscated data.

### 8. **Use of Web Shell**

**Description**: A web shell is a script or tool that allows an attacker to execute commands on a web server remotely, which can be used for data exfiltration, uploading malware, or further system exploitation.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Analyzing **server access logs** for suspicious activity or unusual requests.
    - Checking **error logs** for signs of failed exploit attempts or abnormal behavior.
    - Searching for **suspicious strings** in the logs that indicate encoding, shell execution, or attempts to access unauthorized resources.

### 9. **Data Staging**

**Description**: After successfully infiltrating the network, an adversary may stage data, which involves collecting and organizing sensitive information (e.g., employee data, financial information, intellectual property) for future exfiltration or destruction.

- **Detection Methods**:
    - Monitoring for signs of large data transfers or changes to data storage systems.
    - Detecting unauthorized **data access** or large file movements within the network.
    - Reviewing **file integrity logs** to spot unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive files.

---

By understanding and identifying these adversary behaviors, security professionals can set up better detection mechanisms, monitor the network for unusual activity, and take preventive measures to safeguard against potential attacks.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) 
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are crucial for detecting and responding to potential cyberattacks. These indicators are forensic data points or clues found on a network or system that suggest that a security breach has occurred or is underway. Monitoring IoCs can help cybersecurity professionals detect suspicious activities, prevent attacks, and enhance incident response strategies. IoCs can be categorized into atomic, computed, and behavioral indicators, providing insight into malicious activities.

### **Categories of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**

1. **Email Indicators**:

    - **Examples**:
        - **Sender's Email Address**: Malicious or spoofed email addresses.
        - **Email Subject**: Suspicious or misleading subject lines designed to entice the recipient to open the email.
        - **Attachments/Links**: Malicious attachments (e.g., executable files, macros) or URLs leading to phishing sites or malware downloads.
2. **Network Indicators**:
    
    - **Description**: These indicators help in identifying communication between compromised systems and external attackers, as well as malware delivery methods.
    - **Examples**:
        - **IP Addresses**: Malicious IP addresses used for command-and-control (C2) communication.
        - **URLs**: URLs leading to malicious websites or C2 servers.
        - **Domain Names**: Domains associated with malicious activities (e.g., phishing sites, malware distribution).
3. **Host-Based Indicators**:
    
    - **Description**: These indicators are found on infected systems, providing clues about the compromise or malicious behavior.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Filenames**: Unusual or suspicious filenames that are associated with malware or exploits.
        - **File Hashes**: MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hashes of files that match known malicious software.
        - **Registry Keys**: Unauthorized changes in Windows registry keys indicating persistence mechanisms.
        - **DLLs**: Malicious dynamic link libraries (DLLs) loaded into processes or exploited for malicious purposes.
        - **Mutex**: Unique objects used by malware to prevent multiple instances of itself from running.
4. **Behavioral Indicators**:
    
    - **Description**: These indicators refer to patterns of activity or behaviors that are typically associated with malicious actions, such as abnormal system use or unauthorized processes.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Document Executing PowerShell Scripts**: A document or file that triggers a PowerShell script, often used in malicious macros or exploits.
        - **Remote Command Execution**: Suspicious remote connections or commands issued to systems within the network.
        - **Code Injection**: Malicious code being injected into system memory or processes to gain control over the system.

---

### **Key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**

1. **Unusual Outbound Network Traffic**:
    
    - Increased traffic leaving the network, especially to unknown or suspicious IPs, may indicate data exfiltration or communication with a C2 server.
2. **Unusual Activity Through a Privileged User Account**:
    
    - Malicious activity such as unauthorized access to sensitive systems or files by users with elevated privileges can be a strong indication of an attack.
3. **Geographical Anomalies**:
    
    - Logins or access attempts from geographic locations that do not match the organization's typical operational regions, especially from countries known for malicious activity.
4. **Multiple Login Failures**:
    
    - Failed login attempts across multiple accounts may indicate a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempts.
5. **Increased Database Read Volume**:
    
    - Anomalies in database queries or excessive reading from databases could suggest an attacker is extracting sensitive information.
6. **Large HTML Response Size**:
    
    - Unusual or unexpected HTML response sizes may indicate web scraping or data exfiltration attempts.
7. **Multiple Requests for the Same File**:
    
    - Repeated access to the same file may point to malware or an attacker scanning for sensitive information.
8. **Mismatched Port-Application Traffic**:
    
    - Network traffic on unusual ports or mismatches between port numbers and the application type (e.g., web traffic on non-standard ports) can signal an attack.
9. **Suspicious Registry or System File Changes**:
    
    - Unauthorized changes to critical system files or registry entries often indicate malware installation or system compromise.
10. **Unusual DNS Requests**:
    

- A high volume of DNS requests, particularly to unknown or suspicious domains, can indicate data exfiltration via DNS tunneling or C2 communication.

11. **Unexpected Patching of Systems**:

- Sudden, unauthorized patches or changes to system software could indicate an attacker attempting to cover their tracks or exploit known vulnerabilities.

12. **Signs of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Activity**:

- A sudden surge in traffic that overwhelms system resources, particularly on a target service, may indicate a DDoS attack.

13. **Bundles of Data in the Wrong Places**:

- Unusual data storage or data transmission patterns, such as large amounts of data being stored in inappropriate locations or encrypted.

14. **Web Traffic with Superhuman Behavior**:

- Patterns in web traffic that suggest automated tools (e.g., bots) are interacting with websites in a manner that mimics human actions but on an excessive scale.
