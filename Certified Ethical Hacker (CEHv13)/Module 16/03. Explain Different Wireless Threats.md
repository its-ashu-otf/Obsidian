The different types of wireless network attacks mentioned target various aspects of wireless networks. These attacks are aimed at compromising the **availability**, **integrity**, **confidentiality**, **authentication**, and **access control** of wireless networks. Here's a more detailed explanation of each type of attack:

### **Access Control Attacks**

These attacks target the mechanisms that control which devices can connect to the wireless network. By bypassing these controls, attackers can gain unauthorized access.

- **MAC Spoofing**: Attackers change their device's MAC address to match an authorized device, bypassing MAC filtering that only allows specific devices to connect to the network.
- **AP Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured access points (APs) may have vulnerabilities, such as open or weak security settings, which attackers can exploit.

- **Promiscuous Client**: Attackers may use software to make their device accept all incoming packets, allowing them to sniff traffic and exploit the network.
- **Client Mis-association**: Attackers can force clients to connect to a rogue AP instead of the legitimate one by pretending to be the legitimate AP.

### **Integrity Attacks**

These attacks manipulate or inject malicious data into the network, potentially disrupting the flow of information or launching attacks like DoS (Denial of Service).

- **Data Frame Injection**: Attackers inject malicious frames into the network, corrupting the normal communication or causing disruptions.
- **WEP Injection**: Attackers inject forged WEP-encrypted packets into a network to manipulate the communication.
- **Bit-Flipping Attacks**: Attackers manipulate individual bits in a packet to change the message or behaviour of the wireless network.
- **Extensible AP Replay**: Replays previously captured management or control frames to impersonate the AP and hijack sessions.
- **Data Replay**: Captures valid data frames and replays them later to confuse or attack the network.
- **Initialization Vector Replay Attacks**: Replays an old, captured IV, which is used in WEP and WPA encryption, to break encryption or manipulate data.
- **RADIUS Replay**: Captures RADIUS authentication messages and replays them to authenticate as a valid user.
- **Wireless Network Viruses**: Malicious software targeting wireless network devices or using the network to propagate.

### **Confidentiality Attacks**

These attacks aim to intercept sensitive data or violate the confidentiality of communication over wireless networks, regardless of encryption.

- **Eavesdropping**: Attackers intercept and monitor network traffic to collect sensitive data.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Attackers analyse traffic patterns to gain insights into the communication, even if the data is encrypted.
- **Cracking WEP Key**: Attackers attempt to break WEP encryption and gain access to the transmitted data.
- **Evil Twin AP**: Attackers set up a rogue AP with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate AP. Unsuspecting clients connect to the evil twin, and the attacker can intercept or manipulate the data.
- **Honeypot AP**: A decoy AP used to lure and monitor potential attackers. Once clients connect to the honeypot, the attacker can attempt to steal their data or perform further attacks.
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers intercept and take over an active session between a user and a server.
- **Masquerading**: Attackers impersonate a legitimate device to gain access to the network.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Attackers intercept communication between two devices, allowing them to eavesdrop or manipulate the data being exchanged.

### **Availability Attacks**

These attacks target the availability of the network by disrupting services or denying legitimate users access.

- **Access Point Theft**: Stealing an AP or tampering with it to disrupt its service or cause unauthorized access.
- **Disassociation Attacks**: Attackers send disassociation frames to disconnect clients from the AP, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **EAP-Failure**: Attackers send EAP failure messages to force devices to repeatedly attempt authentication, causing a DoS condition.
- **Beacon Flood**: Attackers flood the wireless network with excessive beacon frames to overwhelm the AP and clients.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Attackers flood the network with unnecessary traffic or disconnect devices, making the network unavailable.
- **De-authenticate Flood**: Attackers send deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the network.
- **Routing Attacks**: Attackers manipulate the routing tables or routing protocols to create network loops or break the communication path.
- **Authenticate Flood**: Attackers flood the network with authentication requests to overload the AP or authentication servers.
- **ARP Cache Poisoning Attack**: Attackers poison the ARP cache of a device, causing it to send packets to the wrong destination, disrupting network traffic.
- **Power Saving Attacks**: Exploit the power-saving mechanisms of wireless devices to launch attacks that cause them to stay awake or interfere with normal communication.
- **TKIP MIC Exploit**: Exploits a weakness in the Michael Integrity Check (MIC) of the WPA encryption protocol (TKIP), allowing attackers to manipulate encrypted data.

### **Authentication Attacks**

These attacks focus on stealing user credentials or compromising the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to the network.

- **PSK Cracking**: Attackers crack the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) used in WPA and WPA2 to authenticate users and gain unauthorized access.
- **Key Reinstallation Attack**: A vulnerability in WPA2 where an attacker forces the client to reinstall an already used encryption key, allowing them to decrypt data.
- **Identity Theft**: Attackers steal personal information like usernames, passwords, and credentials to impersonate legitimate users.
- **LEAP Cracking**: Cracking Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP), a proprietary authentication method, to gain unauthorized access to the network.
- **Shared Key Guessing**: Attackers attempt to guess the shared key used in WPA and WPA2 networks, allowing them to authenticate as legitimate clients.
- **VPN Login Password Cracking**: Attackers try to crack VPN login passwords to gain unauthorized access to the network or resources.
- **Domain Login Application Cracking**: Attackers attempt to crack login credentials for domain-based applications or network resources to steal sensitive data.

### Honeypot AP Attack

A **Honeypot AP (Access Point) Attack** is a wireless network attack where an attacker sets up a **rogue access point** (AP) to trick users into connecting to it instead of a legitimate network. By mimicking the SSID of a trusted network and emitting a stronger signal, the rogue AP lures users, enabling attackers to intercept sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and personal information.

---

### Key Points and Explanation with Examples

#### **1. How Honeypot AP Works**

- **Probing Behavior**:  
    When a wireless client device (like a smartphone or laptop) searches for nearby networks, it probes for a specific SSID (network name).
    
    - **Example**: A user connects to "CoffeeShop_WiFi" frequently. Their device probes for this SSID when turned on.
- **Setting Up the Rogue AP**:  
    The attacker configures a high-power rogue AP using the same SSID as the legitimate network. It broadcasts a stronger signal than the legitimate AP, making devices prioritize it.
    
- **Connection and Data Interception**:  
    When a user connects to the rogue AP, the attacker can:
    
    - Perform a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack, intercepting all traffic.
    - Steal sensitive data like login credentials or session cookies.
    - Inject malicious content (e.g., malware) into the user's device.

---

#### **2. Why Honeypot APs are Dangerous**

- **Identity Theft**: Attackers can steal usernames, passwords, or even personal identity data.
- **Session Hijacking**: By capturing session cookies, attackers can take over authenticated sessions (e.g., email, banking).
- **Data Interception**: All unencrypted traffic (e.g., HTTP) can be viewed and altered.

---

#### **3. Real-World Example of a Honeypot AP Attack**

**Scenario**:

- A user visits a café and connects to "FreeCafeWiFi."
- An attacker sets up a rogue AP with the same SSID ("FreeCafeWiFi") but broadcasts a stronger signal using high-gain antennas.
- The user’s device connects to the rogue AP automatically.
- The attacker monitors the traffic, capturing the user’s login credentials to an online shopping website.

#### **4. Prevention Methods**

1. **User Awareness**:
    
    - Always verify the legitimacy of the Wi-Fi network before connecting.
    - Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks automatically.
2. **Secure Configuration**:
    
    - Use **enterprise-grade security protocols** (e.g., WPA3 Enterprise with EAP).
    - Ensure proper SSID broadcast and signal power control to reduce the chance of spoofing.
3. **Encryption**:
    
    - Use VPNs to encrypt traffic over public Wi-Fi.
    - Prefer websites with **HTTPS** for secure communication.
4. **Network Monitoring Tools**:
    
    - Use tools like **Wireshark** to detect rogue APs.
    - Implement Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) to identify unauthorized APs.
