The different types of wireless network attacks mentioned target various aspects of wireless networks. These attacks are aimed at compromising the **availability**, **integrity**, **confidentiality**, **authentication**, and **access control** of wireless networks. Here's a more detailed explanation of each type of attack:

### **Access Control Attacks**

These attacks target the mechanisms that control which devices can connect to the wireless network. By bypassing these controls, attackers can gain unauthorized access.

- **MAC Spoofing**: Attackers change their device's MAC address to match an authorized device, bypassing MAC filtering that only allows specific devices to connect to the network.
- **AP Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured access points (APs) may have vulnerabilities, such as open or weak security settings, which attackers can exploit.

![[Pasted image 20250113012637.png]]

- **Ad Hoc Associations**: Attackers can join wireless ad hoc networks (peer-to-peer networks), which bypass central AP controls and may not require authentication.

![[Pasted image 20250113012657.png]]

- **Promiscuous Client**: Attackers may use software to make their device accept all incoming packets, allowing them to sniff traffic and exploit the network.
- **Client Mis-association**: Attackers can force clients to connect to a rogue AP instead of the legitimate one by pretending to be the legitimate AP.

![[Pasted image 20250113012718.png]]

- **Unauthorized Association**: Attackers directly connect to an AP without authorization, bypassing access controls.

![[Pasted image 20250113012738.png]]

### **Integrity Attacks**

These attacks manipulate or inject malicious data into the network, potentially disrupting the flow of information or launching attacks like DoS (Denial of Service).

- **Data Frame Injection**: Attackers inject malicious frames into the network, corrupting the normal communication or causing disruptions.
- **WEP Injection**: Attackers inject forged WEP-encrypted packets into a network to manipulate the communication.
- **Bit-Flipping Attacks**: Attackers manipulate individual bits in a packet to change the message or behaviour of the wireless network.
- **Extensible AP Replay**: Replays previously captured management or control frames to impersonate the AP and hijack sessions.
- **Data Replay**: Captures valid data frames and replays them later to confuse or attack the network.
- **Initialization Vector Replay Attacks**: Replays an old, captured IV, which is used in WEP and WPA encryption, to break encryption or manipulate data.
- **RADIUS Replay**: Captures RADIUS authentication messages and replays them to authenticate as a valid user.
- **Wireless Network Viruses**: Malicious software targeting wireless network devices or using the network to propagate.

### **Confidentiality Attacks**

These attacks aim to intercept sensitive data or violate the confidentiality of communication over wireless networks, regardless of encryption.

- **Eavesdropping**: Attackers intercept and monitor network traffic to collect sensitive data.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Attackers analyse traffic patterns to gain insights into the communication, even if the data is encrypted.
- **Cracking WEP Key**: Attackers attempt to break WEP encryption and gain access to the transmitted data.
- **Evil Twin AP**: Attackers set up a rogue AP with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate AP. Unsuspecting clients connect to the evil twin, and the attacker can intercept or manipulate the data.
- **Honeypot AP**: A decoy AP used to lure and monitor potential attackers. Once clients connect to the honeypot, the attacker can attempt to steal their data or perform further attacks.
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers intercept and take over an active session between a user and a server.
- **Masquerading**: Attackers impersonate a legitimate device to gain access to the network.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Attackers intercept communication between two devices, allowing them to eavesdrop or manipulate the data being exchanged.

### **Availability Attacks**

These attacks target the availability of the network by disrupting services or denying legitimate users access.

- **Access Point Theft**: Stealing an AP or tampering with it to disrupt its service or cause unauthorized access.
- **Disassociation Attacks**: Attackers send disassociation frames to disconnect clients from the AP, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **EAP-Failure**: Attackers send EAP failure messages to force devices to repeatedly attempt authentication, causing a DoS condition.
- **Beacon Flood**: Attackers flood the wireless network with excessive beacon frames to overwhelm the AP and clients.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Attackers flood the network with unnecessary traffic or disconnect devices, making the network unavailable.
- **De-authenticate Flood**: Attackers send deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the network.
- **Routing Attacks**: Attackers manipulate the routing tables or routing protocols to create network loops or break the communication path.
- **Authenticate Flood**: Attackers flood the network with authentication requests to overload the AP or authentication servers.
- **ARP Cache Poisoning Attack**: Attackers poison the ARP cache of a device, causing it to send packets to the wrong destination, disrupting network traffic.
- **Power Saving Attacks**: Exploit the power-saving mechanisms of wireless devices to launch attacks that cause them to stay awake or interfere with normal communication.
- **TKIP MIC Exploit**: Exploits a weakness in the Michael Integrity Check (MIC) of the WPA encryption protocol (TKIP), allowing attackers to manipulate encrypted data.

### **Authentication Attacks**

These attacks focus on stealing user credentials or compromising the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to the network.

- **PSK Cracking**: Attackers crack the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) used in WPA and WPA2 to authenticate users and gain unauthorized access.
- **Key Reinstallation Attack**: A vulnerability in WPA2 where an attacker forces the client to reinstall an already used encryption key, allowing them to decrypt data.
- **Identity Theft**: Attackers steal personal information like usernames, passwords, and credentials to impersonate legitimate users.
- **LEAP Cracking**: Cracking Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP), a proprietary authentication method, to gain unauthorized access to the network.
- **Shared Key Guessing**: Attackers attempt to guess the shared key used in WPA and WPA2 networks, allowing them to authenticate as legitimate clients.
- **VPN Login Password Cracking**: Attackers try to crack VPN login passwords to gain unauthorized access to the network or resources.
- **Domain Login Application Cracking**: Attackers attempt to crack login credentials for domain-based applications or network resources to steal sensitive data.

### Honeypot AP Attack

A **Honeypot AP (Access Point) Attack** is a wireless network attack where an attacker sets up a **rogue access point** (AP) to trick users into connecting to it instead of a legitimate network. By mimicking the SSID of a trusted network and emitting a stronger signal, the rogue AP lures users, enabling attackers to intercept sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and personal information.

---

### Key Points and Explanation with Examples

![[Pasted image 20250129003223.png]]

#### **1. How Honeypot AP Works**

- **Probing Behavior**:  
    When a wireless client device (like a smartphone or laptop) searches for nearby networks, it probes for a specific SSID (network name).
    
    - **Example**: A user connects to "CoffeeShop_WiFi" frequently. Their device probes for this SSID when turned on.
- **Setting Up the Rogue AP**:  
    The attacker configures a high-power rogue AP using the same SSID as the legitimate network. It broadcasts a stronger signal than the legitimate AP, making devices prioritize it.
    
- **Connection and Data Interception**:  
    When a user connects to the rogue AP, the attacker can:
    
    - Perform a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack, intercepting all traffic.
    - Steal sensitive data like login credentials or session cookies.
    - Inject malicious content (e.g., malware) into the user's device.

---

#### **2. Why Honeypot APs are Dangerous**

- **Identity Theft**: Attackers can steal usernames, passwords, or even personal identity data.
- **Session Hijacking**: By capturing session cookies, attackers can take over authenticated sessions (e.g., email, banking).
- **Data Interception**: All unencrypted traffic (e.g., HTTP) can be viewed and altered.

---

#### **3. Real-World Example of a Honeypot AP Attack**

**Scenario**:

- A user visits a café and connects to "FreeCafeWiFi."
- An attacker sets up a rogue AP with the same SSID ("FreeCafeWiFi") but broadcasts a stronger signal using high-gain antennas.
- The user’s device connects to the rogue AP automatically.
- The attacker monitors the traffic, capturing the user’s login credentials to an online shopping website.

---

#### **4. Prevention Methods**

1. **User Awareness**:
    
    - Always verify the legitimacy of the Wi-Fi network before connecting.
    - Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks automatically.
2. **Secure Configuration**:
    
    - Use **enterprise-grade security protocols** (e.g., WPA3 Enterprise with EAP).
    - Ensure proper SSID broadcast and signal power control to reduce the chance of spoofing.
3. **Encryption**:
    
    - Use VPNs to encrypt traffic over public Wi-Fi.
    - Prefer websites with **HTTPS** for secure communication.
4. **Network Monitoring Tools**:
    
    - Use tools like **Wireshark** to detect rogue APs.
    - Implement Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) to identify unauthorized APs.

### Wormhole Attack

![[Pasted image 20250129003243.png]]

A **wormhole attack** is a network layer attack targeting **dynamic routing protocols** like Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV). In this attack, an attacker strategically places a malicious node in the network, creating a **tunnel** between two legitimate nodes (source and destination) by forwarding messages through the malicious node. This tunnel manipulates routing protocols, resulting in attackers controlling the communication flow and compromising data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

### Key Points and Explanation with Examples

#### **1. How Wormhole Attacks Work**

- **Routing Protocol Exploitation**:  
    The attacker exploits the route discovery mechanism used in protocols like AODV and DSR.
    
    - **Example**: In a network where Node S wants to communicate with Node D, S sends a Route Request (RREQ) message to D to discover the best route. D replies with a Route Reply (RREP) message.
- **Malicious Node Setup**:  
    The attacker deploys a malicious node (M) that is strategically placed within the communication range of both S and D.
    
    - The attacker intercepts RREQ and RREP messages and forwards them through a high-speed tunnel to manipulate routing tables, creating a **false direct route** between S and D via M.
- **Control of Data Flow**:  
    After the tunnel is established, all communication between S and D is routed through M. The attacker can:
    
    - **Intercept packets** for eavesdropping.
    - **Modify data** or inject malicious packets.
    - **Drop packets**, causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

---

#### **2. Example of a Wormhole Attack**

**Scenario**:

- A military unit uses wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for communication.
- An attacker places a malicious node (M) near two nodes in the network: a source node (S) and a destination node (D).
- When S sends an RREQ to discover a route to D, M captures it and forwards it directly to D via a private high-speed link (wormhole).
- Similarly, M intercepts the RREP from D and sends it to S.
- As a result, S believes M provides the shortest route to D and routes all traffic through it.

**Impact**: The attacker now controls all data between S and D, enabling eavesdropping or data manipulation.

---

#### **3. Consequences of Wormhole Attacks**

- **Eavesdropping**: Sensitive information can be intercepted by attackers.
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Attackers can modify or inject malicious data packets.
- **Routing Disruption**: The attacker can drop packets, disrupt communications, or even isolate nodes from the network.
- **Resource Drain**: Nodes are tricked into using inefficient or compromised routes, consuming more power and bandwidth.

---

#### **4. Preventive Measures**

1. **Authentication of Routing Protocols**:
    
    - Implement cryptographic authentication for RREQ and RREP messages to verify the legitimacy of routing nodes.
2. **Timestamp Verification**:
    
    - Use timestamps to detect delays introduced by attackers in tunneling messages.
3. **Geographic Routing**:
    
    - Implement geographic routing protocols where nodes validate whether a route logically fits based on location.
4. **Packet Leashes**:
    
    - Use **temporal leashes** or **geographic leashes** to limit the transmission distance of packets, preventing tunnels from being established over large distances.
5. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**:
    
    - Deploy IDS to monitor for anomalies in routing behavior, such as an unusual number of packets forwarded by a single node.

---

#### **5. Tools for Ethical Hacking and Testing**

- **NetSim**: Simulates network scenarios to study vulnerabilities to wormhole attacks.
- **NS-3**: A network simulator for evaluating the security of routing protocols.
- **Aircrack-ng Suite**: Can be used to sniff and manipulate wireless network traffic to test for routing vulnerabilities.

### Sinkhole Attack

![[Pasted image 20250129003329.png]]

A **sinkhole attack** is a network layer attack where the attacker compromises a node or deploys a malicious node in a wireless network. The malicious node falsely advertises itself as having the **shortest or best route** to the base station, diverting all traffic from nearby nodes through itself. Once the attacker successfully routes the traffic, they can **eavesdrop**, **manipulate data**, or even perform **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks.

---

### **How Sinkhole Attacks Work**

1. **Compromised/Malicious Node Placement**:  
    The attacker places a malicious node near the base station to intercept as much traffic as possible.
    
2. **Fake Route Advertisement**:  
    The malicious node advertises itself as having the **most efficient route** (e.g., shortest path or least hop count) to the base station.
    
3. **Attracting Neighboring Nodes**:  
    Neighboring nodes send their data to the malicious node, believing it will deliver the data to the base station.
    
4. **Traffic Manipulation**:
    
    - The attacker can **eavesdrop** on sensitive data.
    - They can **alter**, **forge**, or **drop packets**, disrupting communication and potentially launching further attacks like replay or DoS.
    - **Selective Forwarding**: The attacker may only forward certain packets, making the attack harder to detect.
5. **Combining with Wormhole Attacks**:
    
    - The malicious node can use a **wormhole link** to relay the data quickly to the base station, making its route seem even more efficient.
    - This amplifies the attack's effectiveness by tricking more nodes into using the malicious route.

---

### **Impact of Sinkhole Attacks**

- **Confidentiality Violation**: Sensitive information can be exposed.
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Packets can be tampered with, resulting in misinformation or compromised operations.
- **Network Disruption**: Nodes waste resources on inefficient or malicious routes, leading to delays, packet loss, and reduced performance.
- **Availability Risks**: Dropping packets or selectively forwarding traffic can cause partial or complete network failure.

---

### **Examples**

#### Scenario in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN):

1. A malicious node (M) is placed near the base station (B).
2. The attacker configures M to advertise itself as having the **shortest path** to B.
3. Neighboring nodes send their data through M, believing it offers the most efficient route.
4. M intercepts, modifies, or discards packets before forwarding them to B, compromising the network's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### Combining with a Wormhole Attack:

- M may use a high-speed tunnel (wormhole) to forward traffic quickly to B, making its route appear even more efficient.

---

### **Challenges in Detection**

- **Dynamic Routing**: Ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks often use dynamic routing protocols, making it hard to distinguish legitimate nodes from malicious ones.
- **No Physical Boundary**: Wireless networks lack a physical barrier, making them susceptible to attacks from nearby malicious nodes.
- **Subtle Packet Loss**: Selective forwarding by the attacker may go unnoticed for extended periods.

---

### **Countermeasures for Sinkhole Attacks**

1. **Authentication**:
    
    - Implement **cryptographic authentication** for routing protocols to verify the legitimacy of nodes advertising routes.
2. **Trust-Based Routing**:
    
    - Use trust-based routing protocols where nodes assign trust scores to neighbors based on their behavior.
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
    
    - Deploy **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor unusual traffic patterns, such as a single node handling disproportionate amounts of traffic.
4. **Geographic Routing**:
    
    - Use geographic-based routing protocols where nodes select routes based on physical locations rather than advertised metrics.
5. **Multipath Routing**:
    
    - Implement multipath routing to ensure data is sent along multiple routes, reducing reliance on a single node.
6. **Packet Leashes**:
    
    - Use temporal or geographical packet leashes to prevent malicious nodes from advertising fake routes.
7. **Limit Hop Count**:
    
    - Restrict the number of hops or ensure hop count consistency in routing protocols to mitigate false advertisements.

### Inter-Chip Privilege Escalation/Wireless Co-Existence Attack

#### **Overview**

An **Inter-Chip Privilege Escalation Attack** exploits vulnerabilities in wireless communication chips (e.g., Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips). These chips may be designed separately or combined into a **combo chip** for handling multiple communication types. Attackers take advantage of shared resources and communication pathways to manipulate or steal sensitive data, leading to **privilege escalation** or further exploitation.

In **wireless co-existence attacks**, the attacker exploits the interaction between chips (e.g., Bluetooth stealing data from Wi-Fi) to gain unauthorized access to data or perform malicious actions.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Vulnerability in Chip Design**:
    
    - Wireless chips (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, etc.) are often designed to share resources like memory or communication buses to improve efficiency.
    - In a **combo chip**, shared pathways increase the risk of data leakage between protocols.
2. **Exploiting Shared Resources**:
    
    - Attackers exploit flaws in how these chips interact, such as:
        - Shared data buffers.
        - Improper access controls between chips.
        - Poor isolation of communication protocols.
3. **Privilege Escalation**:
    
    - The attacker starts by compromising one chip (e.g., Bluetooth).
    - They then escalate privileges by moving laterally to exploit the other chip (e.g., Wi-Fi), gaining access to credentials, traffic, or sensitive data.
4. **Manipulating Traffic**:
    
    - The compromised chip can manipulate data packets (e.g., modify, drop, or replay).
    - Attackers may capture sensitive information like passwords or encryption keys.

---

### **Impact of the Attack**

1. **Data Theft**:
    
    - Sensitive information, such as user credentials, encryption keys, or personal data, can be extracted by leveraging the compromised chip.
2. **Traffic Manipulation**:
    
    - Attackers can alter, intercept, or redirect traffic between wireless communication protocols.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
    
    - By exploiting chip vulnerabilities, attackers can disrupt wireless communication (e.g., blocking Wi-Fi traffic or disabling Bluetooth connectivity).
4. **Lateral Movement**:
    
    - Once a single chip is compromised, the attacker can target other connected systems or applications.
5. **Device Compromise**:
    
    - Escalated privileges may allow attackers to gain complete control over the device, leading to further exploitation.

---

### **Example Scenarios**

1. **Credential Theft via Bluetooth**:
    
    - A user’s smartphone connects to a rogue Bluetooth device.
    - The Bluetooth chip is compromised and accesses the shared memory of the Wi-Fi chip, stealing credentials for a connected Wi-Fi network.
2. **Manipulating IoT Devices**:
    
    - A combo chip in an IoT device (e.g., smart locks or cameras) is exploited.
    - The attacker uses the Bluetooth chip to inject malicious code into the Wi-Fi module, taking control of the device.

---

### **Prevention and Countermeasures**

1. **Chip-Level Security Enhancements**:
    
    - Manufacturers should:
        - Enforce **hardware-level isolation** between chips.
        - Ensure **secure boot** mechanisms for each chip.
        - Implement **robust access control mechanisms** to prevent unauthorized resource sharing.
2. **Firmware Updates**:
    
    - Ensure all wireless chips have updated firmware to address known vulnerabilities.
    - Regularly patch devices to protect against emerging threats.
3. **Cryptographic Isolation**:
    
    - Use **independent encryption keys** for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to prevent cross-chip data theft.
4. **Traffic Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**:
    
    - Deploy tools to monitor unusual activity between wireless communication protocols.
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can flag abnormal communication patterns.
5. **Limit Shared Resources**:
    
    - Reduce or eliminate shared memory, communication buses, or resources between chips.
6. **User Awareness**:
    
    - Avoid connecting to unknown or untrusted Bluetooth/Wi-Fi devices.
    - Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use to reduce attack surfaces.
