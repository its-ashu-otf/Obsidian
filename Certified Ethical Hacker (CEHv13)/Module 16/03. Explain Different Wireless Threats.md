The different types of wireless network attacks mentioned target various aspects of wireless networks. These attacks are aimed at compromising the **availability**, **integrity**, **confidentiality**, **authentication**, and **access control** of wireless networks. Here's a more detailed explanation of each type of attack:

### **Access Control Attacks**

These attacks target the mechanisms that control which devices can connect to the wireless network. By bypassing these controls, attackers can gain unauthorized access.

- **MAC Spoofing**: Attackers change their device's MAC address to match an authorized device, bypassing MAC filtering that only allows specific devices to connect to the network.
- **AP Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured access points (APs) may have vulnerabilities, such as open or weak security settings, which attackers can exploit.
- **Ad Hoc Associations**: Attackers can join wireless ad hoc networks (peer-to-peer networks), which bypass central AP controls and may not require authentication.
- **Promiscuous Client**: Attackers may use software to make their device accept all incoming packets, allowing them to sniff traffic and exploit the network.
- **Client Mis-association**: Attackers can force clients to connect to a rogue AP instead of the legitimate one by pretending to be the legitimate AP.
- **Unauthorized Association**: Attackers directly connect to an AP without authorization, bypassing access controls.

### **Integrity Attacks**

These attacks manipulate or inject malicious data into the network, potentially disrupting the flow of information or launching attacks like DoS (Denial of Service).

- **Data Frame Injection**: Attackers inject malicious frames into the network, corrupting the normal communication or causing disruptions.
- **WEP Injection**: Attackers inject forged WEP-encrypted packets into a network to manipulate the communication.
- **Bit-Flipping Attacks**: Attackers manipulate individual bits in a packet to change the message or behaviour of the wireless network.
- **Extensible AP Replay**: Replays previously captured management or control frames to impersonate the AP and hijack sessions.
- **Data Replay**: Captures valid data frames and replays them later to confuse or attack the network.
- **Initialization Vector Replay Attacks**: Replays an old, captured IV, which is used in WEP and WPA encryption, to break encryption or manipulate data.
- **RADIUS Replay**: Captures RADIUS authentication messages and replays them to authenticate as a valid user.
- **Wireless Network Viruses**: Malicious software targeting wireless network devices or using the network to propagate.

### **Confidentiality Attacks**

These attacks aim to intercept sensitive data or violate the confidentiality of communication over wireless networks, regardless of encryption.

- **Eavesdropping**: Attackers intercept and monitor network traffic to collect sensitive data.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Attackers analyse traffic patterns to gain insights into the communication, even if the data is encrypted.
- **Cracking WEP Key**: Attackers attempt to break WEP encryption and gain access to the transmitted data.
- **Evil Twin AP**: Attackers set up a rogue AP with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate AP. Unsuspecting clients connect to the evil twin, and the attacker can intercept or manipulate the data.
- **Honeypot AP**: A decoy AP used to lure and monitor potential attackers. Once clients connect to the honeypot, the attacker can attempt to steal their data or perform further attacks.
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers intercept and take over an active session between a user and a server.
- **Masquerading**: Attackers impersonate a legitimate device to gain access to the network.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Attackers intercept communication between two devices, allowing them to eavesdrop or manipulate the data being exchanged.

### **Availability Attacks**

These attacks target the availability of the network by disrupting services or denying legitimate users access.

- **Access Point Theft**: Stealing an AP or tampering with it to disrupt its service or cause unauthorized access.
- **Disassociation Attacks**: Attackers send disassociation frames to disconnect clients from the AP, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **EAP-Failure**: Attackers send EAP failure messages to force devices to repeatedly attempt authentication, causing a DoS condition.
- **Beacon Flood**: Attackers flood the wireless network with excessive beacon frames to overwhelm the AP and clients.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Attackers flood the network with unnecessary traffic or disconnect devices, making the network unavailable.
- **De-authenticate Flood**: Attackers send deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the network.
- **Routing Attacks**: Attackers manipulate the routing tables or routing protocols to create network loops or break the communication path.
- **Authenticate Flood**: Attackers flood the network with authentication requests to overload the AP or authentication servers.
- **ARP Cache Poisoning Attack**: Attackers poison the ARP cache of a device, causing it to send packets to the wrong destination, disrupting network traffic.
- **Power Saving Attacks**: Exploit the power-saving mechanisms of wireless devices to launch attacks that cause them to stay awake or interfere with normal communication.
- **TKIP MIC Exploit**: Exploits a weakness in the Michael Integrity Check (MIC) of the WPA encryption protocol (TKIP), allowing attackers to manipulate encrypted data.

### **Authentication Attacks**

These attacks focus on stealing user credentials or compromising the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to the network.

- **PSK Cracking**: Attackers crack the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) used in WPA and WPA2 to authenticate users and gain unauthorized access.
- **Key Reinstallation Attack**: A vulnerability in WPA2 where an attacker forces the client to reinstall an already used encryption key, allowing them to decrypt data.
- **Identity Theft**: Attackers steal personal information like usernames, passwords, and credentials to impersonate legitimate users.
- **LEAP Cracking**: Cracking Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP), a proprietary authentication method, to gain unauthorized access to the network.
- **Shared Key Guessing**: Attackers attempt to guess the shared key used in WPA and WPA2 networks, allowing them to authenticate as legitimate clients.
- **VPN Login Password Cracking**: Attackers try to crack VPN login passwords to gain unauthorized access to the network or resources.
- **Domain Login Application Cracking**: Attackers attempt to crack login credentials for domain-based applications or network resources to steal sensitive data.

---

These attacks can have serious implications on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of wireless networks, so strong security practices, including proper encryption (WPA2, WPA3), intrusion detection, regular monitoring, and secure authentication methods (EAP, RADIUS) should be employed to mitigate risks.
