### **Key Wireless Terminology (Simplified)**

#### **1. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM):**

- **What is it?**  
    A global standard for mobile data and voice communication.
- **Example:**  
    When you make a call or send a text, your mobile phone uses GSM technology to connect to the network.

#### **2. Bandwidth:**

- **What is it?**  
    The amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a specific time, measured in bits per second (bps).
- **Example:**
    - A 100 Mbps internet connection can transfer up to 100 million bits of data per second, making it faster than a 10 Mbps connection.

#### **3. Access Point (AP):**

- **What is it?**  
    A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired or wireless network.
- **Example:**  
    Your home Wi-Fi router is an access point that connects your smartphone, laptop, and other devices to the internet.

#### **4. Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID):**

- **What is it?**  
    The MAC (Media Access Control) address of a wireless access point (AP).
- **Example:**  
    If you’re moving around with a laptop in an office, it may automatically switch from one BSSID (AP) to another for better signal strength without dropping the connection.

#### **5. Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) Band:**

- **What is it?**  
    A set of frequencies used globally for non-commercial purposes, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or microwave ovens.
- **Example:**  
    Wi-Fi operates on ISM bands like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

#### **6. Hotspot:**

- **What is it?**  
    A location where wireless internet is publicly available.
- **Example:**  
    Coffee shops, airports, and libraries often offer free or paid Wi-Fi hotspots.

#### **7. Association:**

- **What is it?**  
    The process of connecting your wireless device to an access point.
- **Example:**  
    When you connect your smartphone to your home Wi-Fi network, it "associates" with the router.

#### **8. Service Set Identifier (SSID):**

- **What is it?**  
    The name of a wireless network. Devices need to know the SSID to connect.
- **Example:**  
    Your home Wi-Fi might have an SSID like "MyHomeWiFi." All devices must select this name to connect.

#### **9. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM):**

- **What is it?**  
    A technique for transmitting data by splitting it across multiple frequencies to reduce interference and improve speed.
- **Example:**  
    OFDM is used in modern Wi-Fi standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 6) to provide faster and more stable connections.

#### **10. Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO-OFDM):**

- **What is it?**  
    An advanced version of OFDM using multiple antennas to boost data transfer speed and reduce interference.
- **Example:**  
    Many 5G networks and modern Wi-Fi routers use MIMO to allow faster connections when multiple devices are connected.

#### **11. Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS):**

- **What is it?**  
    A technique that spreads data across multiple frequencies to make it more secure and resistant to interference.
- **Example:**  
    Used in older Wi-Fi standards like 802.11b.

#### **12. Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS):**

- **What is it?**  
    A method where the transmitter switches between frequencies in a random order to prevent jamming or interception.
- **Example:**  
    Bluetooth uses FHSS to securely transfer data without interference from other devices.

### **Examples to Bring It All Together**

1. **At a Coffee Shop (Hotspot):**  
    You connect your phone to a Wi-Fi network named “CoffeeLoungeWiFi” (SSID). The network uses OFDM to provide a fast connection, while FHSS ensures your data isn't intercepted.
    
2. **Making a Call (GSM):**  
    Your phone communicates with a nearby cell tower using GSM technology, ensuring your voice data is securely transmitted.
    
3. **Office Wi-Fi (Access Point & BSSID):**  
    When you walk around the office with your laptop, it connects to different access points (APs) with unique BSSIDs for the best signal strength, all while staying on the same SSID.

## Wireless Networks

Wireless network (Wi-Fi) refers to WLANs based on IEEE 802.11 standard, which allows a device to access the network from anywhere within an AP range.A

Wireless networks rely on **radio waves**, which operate at the **physical layer** of the network. Wi-Fi, based on the IEEE **802.11 standard**, enables wireless communication by connecting devices like PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles to the internet via an **Access Point (AP)**.

### **Disadvantages of Wireless Networks**

1. **Security Concerns:**  
    _Example:_ Open public Wi-Fi can be vulnerable to hackers if not secured.
    
2. **Bandwidth Limitations:**  
    _Example:_ Internet speed drops as more devices connect to the same AP.
    
3. **Upgrade Costs:**  
    _Example:_ Older devices may require new Wi-Fi cards to connect to modern APs.
    
4. **Interference:**
