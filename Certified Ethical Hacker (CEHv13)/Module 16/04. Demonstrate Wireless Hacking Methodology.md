steps of the wireless hacking methodology.

## Wi- Fi Discovery: Wireless Network Footprinting

- Attacking a wireless network begins with discovering and footprinting the wireless network actively or passively

![[Pasted image 20250129003723.png]]

Wi-Fi discovery is the initial step attackers use to locate and analyze wireless networks before launching an attack. The process involves identifying the **Service Set Identifier (SSID)**, network configurations, and available devices. This is achieved through **footprinting**, which can be done passively or actively.

---

### **Wi-Fi Footprinting Methods**

1. **Passive Footprinting**
    
    - In this method, the attacker **sniffs Wi-Fi traffic** by capturing packets transmitted over the airwaves.
    - The attacker does not interact with the network or send any data, making this method stealthy and difficult to detect.
    - Tools like **Wireshark**, **Kismet**, or **Aircrack-ng** are commonly used.
    - Information gathered includes:
        - **SSID** (from beacon frames or probe responses).
        - **MAC addresses** of access points and connected devices.
        - Network configurations (e.g., encryption type: WPA2, WPA3).
    
    **Process**:
    
    - The attacker listens to beacon frames broadcast by access points (APs), which contain details like the SSID and BSSID.
    - If encryption is weak, further sniffing can capture more sensitive information, such as handshake packets for decryption attempts.
    
    **Advantages**:
    
    - Undetectable since the attacker doesn’t transmit any signals.

---

2. **Active Footprinting**
    
    - In active footprinting, the attacker actively engages with the network by sending **probe requests** to access points and awaiting responses.
    - If the attacker doesn’t know the SSID, they send a **probe request with an empty SSID**, prompting APs to respond with their SSID in a **probe response packet**.
    - This method allows the attacker to:
        - Identify hidden SSIDs.
        - Confirm the existence of specific networks.
    
    **Process**:
    
    - The attacker’s wireless device scans for APs in the area.
    - It sends targeted or broadcast probe requests.
    - APs respond with probe responses that include their SSID and other network details.
    
    **Advantages**:
    
    - Can uncover SSIDs hidden or missed during passive footprinting.
    
    **Drawbacks**:
    
    - Easier to detect because the attacker transmits signals.

### **Tools for Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Passive Scanning Tools**:
    
    - **Wireshark**: Captures and analyzes wireless traffic.
    - **Kismet**: Detects Wi-Fi networks and devices in a passive manner.
    - **tcpdump**: Command-line tool for packet capture and analysis.
2. **Active Scanning Tools**:
    
    - **NetSurveyor**: Scans and maps available Wi-Fi networks.
    - **inSSIDer**: Identifies nearby networks and provides information such as channel usage.
    - **Acrylic Wi-Fi**: Provides details on SSIDs, BSSIDs, and signal strength.

---

### **Information Collected During Footprinting**

- **SSID**: Identifies the network name.
- **BSSID**: The MAC address of the AP.
- **Encryption Type**: Determines the level of security (e.g., WPA2, WPA3).
- **Channel**: Identifies the frequency band in use.
- **Signal Strength**: Determines the distance between the AP and the attacker.

---

### **Countermeasures to Prevent Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Hiding the SSID**:
    
    - Disable SSID broadcast in the router settings.
    - Note: Hidden SSIDs can still be detected through passive scanning of probe and association requests.
2. **Use Strong Encryption**:
    
    - Employ WPA3 encryption to secure the network.
    - Avoid outdated protocols like WEP or WPA.
3. **MAC Filtering**:
    
    - Allow only specific MAC addresses to connect to the network.
    - Note: MAC addresses can be spoofed, so this is not foolproof.
4. **Enable Rogue AP Detection**:
    
    - Use enterprise-grade wireless controllers to detect unauthorized APs or rogue devices.
5. **Monitor Wireless Traffic**:
    
    - Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like **AirDefense** to detect unusual scanning behavior.
6. **Use a VPN**:
    
    - Protect data over Wi-Fi by encrypting it with a VPN.

---

### **Attacker Workflow for Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Discovery**:
    
    - Scan for wireless networks using active or passive methods.
    - Identify SSIDs, BSSIDs, and network configurations.
2. **Footprinting**:
    
    - Collect detailed information such as encryption type, channel, and signal strength.
3. **Connection**:
    
    - Attempt to connect to the network using captured information (e.g., weak encryption or default credentials).
4. **Launch Attack**:
    
    - Perform attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM), packet injection, or denial of service (DoS).

---

### **Example Scenario**

1. An attacker sets up a laptop with a Wi-Fi adapter in monitor mode.
2. Using **Kismet**, they passively capture packets to identify nearby APs.
3. Unable to find the SSID of a hidden network, they switch to active scanning using **NetSurveyor**, sending empty SSID probe requests.
4. The AP responds with its SSID, allowing the attacker to target the network.

## Wi- Fi Discovery: Finding Wi- Fi Networks in Range to Attack

- The first task an attacker will go through when searching for Wi-Fi targets is checking the potential networks that are in range to find the best one to attack
- Drive around with Wi-Fi enabled laptop installed with a wireless discovery tool such as **inSSIDer** and map out active wireless networks

### Finding Wi-Fi Networks in Range to Attack

### Wi- Fi Discovery: Finding WPS- Enabled APs

- Attackers use Wash utility to identify the WPS-enabled APs and detect if the AP is in locked or unlocked state
- Most of the WPSs in the routers usually lock when brute forced for more than five times and can be unlocked only in the administrator interface of the router manually
- The Wash command can support the 5 GHz channel
- The attacker discovers the AP, ESSID, and BSSID of a device or router using the following wash command
```bash
ashu@kali $ sudo wash -i wlanO
```


The Wash utility is a command-line tool used by attackers to identify **WPS-enabled access points (APs)** in a target wireless network. It is commonly installed as part of the **Reaver** package and is an essential tool for reconnaissance in wireless penetration testing. Wash helps determine if WPS is enabled on a router and checks whether it is in a **locked state**.

---

### **Key Features of Wash**:

1. **WPS Detection**:
    
    - Identifies access points that have **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)** enabled.
    - Helps attackers identify routers vulnerable to WPS-based brute-force attacks.
2. **Lock State Verification**:
    
    - Detects whether the AP is locked after multiple incorrect credential attempts.
    - Most WPS-enabled routers lock themselves automatically after 5+ failed login attempts, requiring manual intervention from the administrator to unlock.
3. **Channel Scanning**:
    
    - Supports both **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** frequency bands for AP discovery.

### **Important Wash Command Arguments**

|**Argument**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-i, --interface=<iface>`|Specifies the **network interface** to capture packets (e.g., wlan0).|
|`-a, --all`|Displays all APs, including those with WPS disabled.|
|`-f, --file [FILES]`|Reads packets from specified **capture files** (e.g., .pcap files).|
|`-c, --channel <num>`|Specifies the **channel** to listen on (default is automatic scanning across all channels).|
|`-o, --out-file <file>`|Writes the discovered AP data to an **output file**.|
|`-n, --probes=<n>`|Specifies the maximum number of **probes** to send to each AP during the scan mode.|
|`-D, --daemonize`|Runs the **Wash command in the background** (daemon mode).|
|`-5, --5ghz`|Enables scanning of **5 GHz 802.11 channels**.|
|`-s, --scan`|Runs Wash in **scan mode**.|
|`-u, --survey`|Runs Wash in **survey mode** (default).|

### **Example Wash Command**

The following command can be used to scan for WPS-enabled APs, identify their **ESSID**, and determine their **BSSID**:

```bash
wash -i wlan0 --5ghz -c 6 -o output.txt
```

**Explanation**:

- `-i wlan0`: Specifies the network interface to capture packets (e.g., wlan0).
- `--5ghz`: Enables scanning of 5 GHz channels.
- `-c 6`: Limits the scan to channel 6.
- `-o output.txt`: Saves the scan results to a file named `output.txt`.

### **Common Wash Workflow for Attackers**

1. **Install the Reaver Package**:  
    Use the following command to install Reaver and Wash:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install reaver
    ```
    
2. **Check for Wireless Interfaces**:  
    Identify the wireless interface with:
    
    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```
    
3. **Enable Monitor Mode**:  
    Set the wireless interface to monitor mode:
    
    ```bash
    airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```
    
4. **Run Wash**:  
    Execute the Wash command to scan for WPS-enabled APs:
    
    ```bash
    wash -i wlan0mon
    ```
    

---

### **Output of Wash Command**

The Wash utility provides details about the target APs, such as:

- **BSSID**: Basic Service Set Identifier (unique MAC address of the AP).
- **ESSID**: Extended Service Set Identifier (SSID or network name).
- **WPS State**: Indicates whether WPS is enabled and locked.
- **Channel**: The radio channel the AP is operating on.

Sample Output:

```
BSSID              Channel   WPS Version  WPS Locked  ESSID
00:14:22:01:23:45  6         1.0          No          HomeNetwork
00:25:9C:3F:12:89  11        1.0          Yes         OfficeWiFi
```
