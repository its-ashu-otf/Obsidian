4. Wi-Fi Encryption Cracking
5. Compromise the Wi-Fi Network

To hack wireless networks, an attacker follows a hacking methodology involving systematic
steps to perform a successful attack on a target wireless network. This section explains the
steps of the wireless hacking methodology.

## Wi- Fi Discovery: Wireless Network Footprinting

- Attacking a wireless network begins with discovering and footprinting the wireless network actively or passively

Wi-Fi discovery is the initial step attackers use to locate and analyze wireless networks before launching an attack. The process involves identifying the **Service Set Identifier (SSID)**, network configurations, and available devices. This is achieved through **footprinting**, which can be done passively or actively.

### **Wi-Fi Footprinting Methods**

1. **Passive Footprinting**
    
    - In this method, the attacker **sniffs Wi-Fi traffic** by capturing packets transmitted over the airwaves.
    - The attacker does not interact with the network or send any data, making this method stealthy and difficult to detect.
    - Tools like **Wireshark**, **Kismet**, or **Aircrack-ng** are commonly used.
    - Information gathered includes:
        - **SSID** (from beacon frames or probe responses).
        - **MAC addresses** of access points and connected devices.
        - Network configurations (e.g., encryption type: WPA2, WPA3).
    
    **Process**:
    
    - The attacker listens to beacon frames broadcast by access points (APs), which contain details like the SSID and BSSID.
    - If encryption is weak, further sniffing can capture more sensitive information, such as handshake packets for decryption attempts.
    
    **Advantages**:
    
    - Undetectable since the attacker doesn’t transmit any signals.

2. **Active Footprinting**
    
    - In active footprinting, the attacker actively engages with the network by sending **probe requests** to access points and awaiting responses.
    - If the attacker doesn’t know the SSID, they send a **probe request with an empty SSID**, prompting APs to respond with their SSID in a **probe response packet**.
    - This method allows the attacker to:
        - Identify hidden SSIDs.
        - Confirm the existence of specific networks.
    
    **Process**:
    
    - The attacker’s wireless device scans for APs in the area.
    - It sends targeted or broadcast probe requests.
    - APs respond with probe responses that include their SSID and other network details.
    
    **Advantages**:
    
    - Can uncover SSIDs hidden or missed during passive footprinting.
    
    **Drawbacks**:
    
    - Easier to detect because the attacker transmits signals.

### **Tools for Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Passive Scanning Tools**:
    
    - **Wireshark**: Captures and analyzes wireless traffic.
    - **Kismet**: Detects Wi-Fi networks and devices in a passive manner.
    - **tcpdump**: Command-line tool for packet capture and analysis.
2. **Active Scanning Tools**:
    
    - **NetSurveyor**: Scans and maps available Wi-Fi networks.
    - **inSSIDer**: Identifies nearby networks and provides information such as channel usage.
    - **Acrylic Wi-Fi**: Provides details on SSIDs, BSSIDs, and signal strength.

---

### **Information Collected During Footprinting**

- **SSID**: Identifies the network name.
- **BSSID**: The MAC address of the AP.
- **Encryption Type**: Determines the level of security (e.g., WPA2, WPA3).
- **Channel**: Identifies the frequency band in use.
- **Signal Strength**: Determines the distance between the AP and the attacker.

---

### **Countermeasures to Prevent Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Hiding the SSID**:
    
    - Disable SSID broadcast in the router settings.
    - Note: Hidden SSIDs can still be detected through passive scanning of probe and association requests.
2. **Use Strong Encryption**:
    
    - Employ WPA3 encryption to secure the network.
    - Avoid outdated protocols like WEP or WPA.
3. **MAC Filtering**:
    
    - Allow only specific MAC addresses to connect to the network.
    - Note: MAC addresses can be spoofed, so this is not foolproof.
4. **Enable Rogue AP Detection**:
    
    - Use enterprise-grade wireless controllers to detect unauthorized APs or rogue devices.
5. **Monitor Wireless Traffic**:
    
    - Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like **AirDefense** to detect unusual scanning behavior.
6. **Use a VPN**:
    
    - Protect data over Wi-Fi by encrypting it with a VPN.

### **Attacker Workflow for Wi-Fi Discovery**

1. **Discovery**:
    
    - Scan for wireless networks using active or passive methods.
    - Identify SSIDs, BSSIDs, and network configurations.
2. **Footprinting**:
    
    - Collect detailed information such as encryption type, channel, and signal strength.
3. **Connection**:
    
    - Attempt to connect to the network using captured information (e.g., weak encryption or default credentials).
4. **Launch Attack**:
    
    - Perform attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM), packet injection, or denial of service (DoS).

### **Example Scenario**

1. An attacker sets up a laptop with a Wi-Fi adapter in monitor mode.
2. Using **Kismet**, they passively capture packets to identify nearby APs.
3. Unable to find the SSID of a hidden network, they switch to active scanning using **NetSurveyor**, sending empty SSID probe requests.
4. The AP responds with its SSID, allowing the attacker to target the network.

## Wi- Fi Discovery: Finding Wi- Fi Networks in Range to Attack

- The first task an attacker will go through when searching for Wi-Fi targets is checking the potential networks that are in range to find the best one to attack
- Drive around with Wi-Fi enabled laptop installed with a wireless discovery tool such as **inSSIDer** and map out active wireless networks

### Finding Wi-Fi Networks in Range to Attack
The first task for an attacker searching for Wi-Fi targets is to check potential networks that are
in range to find the best one to attack. Attackers use various Wi-Fi chalking techniques such as
WarWalking, WarChalking, WarFlying, and WarDriving to find a target Wi-Fi network.

 - Wi-Fi Chalking Techniques
	- WarWalking: Attackers walk around with Wi-Fi-enabled laptops installed with a wireless discovery tool to map out open wireless networks.
	- WarChalking: Symbols are drawn in public places to advertise open Wi-Fi networks.
	- WarFlying: Attackers use drones to detect open wireless networks.
	- WarDriving: Attackers drive around with Wi-Fi-enabled laptops installed with a wireless discovery tool to map out open wireless networks.
