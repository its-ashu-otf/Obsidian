# Passive Reconnaissance

### Search Engines in Footprinting

Search engines are powerful tools for gathering valuable information during the **footprinting** process. They act as an extensive database that indexes the content of websites and provides easy access to critical data about a target organization. Search engines can reveal a lot of information that can be used for social engineering, system attacks, and other malicious activities.

---

### **How Search Engines Work**

1. **Crawlers and Indexing**
    
    - Search engines use **automated software called crawlers** to scan websites for new or updated content.
    - These crawlers gather information from the web, such as web pages, images, videos, and other file types, and store the data in an **index**.
    - The search engine's index is a huge database of URLs and content, which allows users to find information by searching specific keywords.
2. **Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)**
    
    - When a user queries the search engine, it returns a list of results called **Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)**.
    - SERPs contain various types of content, including web pages, news articles, videos, images, and PDFs.
    - These results are ranked based on their relevance to the search query, with the most relevant or authoritative content displayed first.

---

### **How Search Engines Help in Footprinting**

Search engines can provide crucial insights that attackers or ethical hackers can use to gather information about a target organization:

1. **Technology Platforms**
    
    - By searching specific terms or file types, attackers can find information about the **technology stack** (such as the server software, CMS, or web frameworks) that a website uses.
    - Example: Searching for `powered by WordPress` can reveal websites built on WordPress.
2. **Employee Details**
    
    - Search engines can index publicly available employee information such as names, job titles, and email addresses.
    - Example: Searching for `"employee directory" site:company.com` might reveal publicly accessible employee lists.
3. **Login Pages and Intranet Portals**
    
    - Attackers can find login pages or intranet portals that may be exposed unintentionally. These pages might be vulnerable to attacks like **brute force** or **credential stuffing**.
    - Example: Searching for `inurl:login site:company.com` might show login pages exposed to the internet.
4. **Contact Information**
    
    - Many organizations publicly list their contact information (emails, phone numbers, physical addresses) for customer support or business inquiries. This information can be used for **social engineering** attacks.
    - Example: Searching for `contact email site:company.com` or `phone number site:company.com` could return contact info.
5. **Sensitive Documents and Files**
    
    - Search engines can index file types such as PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files, which may contain sensitive information, including internal reports, passwords, or proprietary business data.
    - Example: Searching for `filetype:pdf "confidential" site:company.com` could reveal documents labeled as confidential.

---

### **Example Search Engine Queries for Footprinting**

6. **Finding Employee Information**
    
    - `site:linkedin.com "company name" employees`
    - This query searches for employees listed under the company on LinkedIn.
7. **Identifying Login Pages**
    
    - `inurl:login site:company.com`
    - This query finds login pages within the company’s website.
8. **Finding Public Documents**
    
    - `filetype:pdf "report" site:company.com`
    - This finds PDF reports uploaded by the organization.
9. **Exposing Technologies**
    
    - `intitle:"powered by WordPress" site:company.com`
    - This identifies websites that may be using WordPress.

---

### **Risks of Search Engines in Footprinting**

10. **Social Engineering**
    
    - With the data collected from search engines, attackers can impersonate legitimate parties and trick employees into disclosing sensitive information, such as login credentials or internal procedures.
11. **Exposing Sensitive Data**
    
    - Sometimes organizations unknowingly expose sensitive information such as documents, files, and private databases that can be indexed by search engines.
12. **Discovering Vulnerabilities**
    
    - Search engine queries may reveal outdated or vulnerable technologies used by the target, helping attackers exploit known vulnerabilities.

---

### **Conclusion**

Search engines are an essential source of information during footprinting. By analyzing search engine results, attackers or ethical hackers can gather critical data about a target organization’s **technology**, **employees**, **internal systems**, and **sensitive files**. This data can be used for further attacks like **social engineering**, **phishing**, or **system exploitation**. It’s crucial for organizations to monitor what information is publicly accessible via search engines and take steps to secure or remove sensitive data from their websites and other online sources.

## Footprinting Using Advanced Google Hacking Techniques

- Attackers use search engines to **extract information about a target**, such as employed technology platforms, employee details, login pages, and intranet portals, which help the attacker to perform social engineering and other types of advanced system attacks
- Google hacking refers to the use of advanced Google search operators for **creating complex search queries** to extract sensitive or hidden information that helps attackers find vulnerable targets

### Popular Google advanced search operators

|**Search Operator**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**site:**|Restricts search results to the specified site or domain. Example: `[games site: www.certifiedhacker.com]`|
|**allinurl:**|Restricts results to only pages containing all the query terms in the URL. Example: `[allinurl: google career]`|
|**inurl:**|Restricts results to pages containing the specified word in the URL. Example: `[inurl: copy site:www.google.com]`|

These search operators can help refine your queries to extract very specific information about a target during footprinting and reconnaissance.
# **Cheat Sheet to Google Dorking**

![[adv_op_ref.pdf]]

Google Hacking is a technique where hackers use advanced search operators in Google to find sensitive or private information on websites. By crafting specific queries, they can filter through a large number of search results and pinpoint vulnerable systems, exposed data, or even private login pages.

Here’s what hackers can find using Google Hacking:

1. **Error Messages**: Some websites show error messages with sensitive details about their servers or databases, which can help attackers identify weaknesses.
2. **Files Containing Passwords**: Hackers can find exposed files that contain passwords, like text files or documents.
3. **Sensitive Directories**: Sometimes, sensitive folders are publicly accessible. Google Hacking can help find these exposed directories.
4. **Login Pages**: Pages where users log in can be found and targeted for attacks.
5. **Network or Vulnerability Data**: This includes configuration files, firewall logs, or intrusion detection system (IDS) data that may be publicly accessible by mistake.
6. **Advisories and Vulnerabilities**: Hackers can find security advisories or known vulnerabilities listed on websites, which can then be exploited.
7. **Software Version Information**: Exposing the version of software running on a server can help hackers find known vulnerabilities in that specific version.
8. **Web Application Source Code**: Sometimes the source code of web applications is exposed, which gives hackers valuable insights into vulnerabilities.
9. **IoT Devices**: Unprotected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart home systems or cameras, can also be located.
10. **Hidden Web Pages**: Google Hacking can help find internal web pages that were supposed to be private, such as VPN services or intranet sites.

For example, an attacker might use the query `intitle: intranet inurl: intranet +intext: "human resources"` to search for information about an organization's intranet or HR data. This information could be used for social engineering attacks or to exploit vulnerabilities.

By using advanced search techniques, hackers can gather sensitive information without directly hacking the website.

## Footprinting Using Advanced Google Hacking Techniques with Al
An attacker can also leverage **Al-powered ChatGPT** or other generative Al technology to perform this task by using an appropriate prompt such as:

**''Use filetype search operator to obtain pdf files on the target website eccouncil.org and store the result in the recon1 .txt file"**

![[Pasted image 20250205235105.png]]

This shell command is designed to automate the process of conducting Google Hacking to find PDF files within the `eccouncil.org` domain and save the links to a file. Here's a breakdown of each part of the command:

1. **`lynx --dump http://www.google.com/search?q=site:eccouncil.org+filetype:pdf`**
    
    - **Lynx** is a text-based web browser.
    - **`--dump`** tells Lynx to output the contents of the page to the terminal (rather than rendering it in a browser).
    - **`http://www.google.com/search?q=site:eccouncil.org+filetype:pdf`** is the URL for Google search that looks for PDF files within the `eccouncil.org` domain.
2. **`| grep "http"`**
    
    - This command filters the output from Lynx to only show lines that contain the string "http", effectively narrowing the results to URLs.
3. **`| cut -d "=" -f2`**
    
    - This command splits each line of text at the "=" character and takes the second part (i.e., the URL itself).
    - **`-d "="`** specifies the delimiter to split on, and **`-f2`** tells `cut` to select the second field (after the `=`).
4. **`| grep -o "http[^\&]*"`**
    
    - This command extracts only the URL starting with `http`, ensuring that it captures the full URL until it encounters an "&" character (which may be part of the query string in the URL).
5. **`> reconl.txt`**
    
    - The final result (the list of PDF file URLs) is saved to a text file named `reconl.txt` using the **`>`** operator.

In essence, this script automates the task of searching for PDF files in the `eccouncil.org` domain using Google, filters the results, extracts the URLs, and saves them for further analysis.

## Google Hacking Database

- The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is an authoritative source for querying the ever-widening reach of the Google search engine
- Attackers use Google dorks in Google advanced search operators to extract sensitive information about their target, such as exposed files, directories, and devices that could be exploited, vulnerable servers, error messages, sensitive files, login pages, and websites

![[Pasted image 20250205235305.png]]

Google Hacking Database Categories:
■ Footholds
■ Files Containing Usernames
■ Sensitive Directories
■ Web Server Detection
■ Vulnerable Files
■ Vulnerable Servers
■ Error Messages
■ Files Containing Juicy Info
■ Files Containing Passwords
■ Sensitive Online Shopping Info
■ Network or Vulnerability Data
■ Pages Containing Login Portals
■ Various Online Devices
■ Advisories and Vulnerabilities

The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a powerful resource for attackers to conduct reconnaissance and identify potential vulnerabilities in various systems. Here's how attackers leverage GHDB in different stages of an attack:

### 1. **Reconnaissance**

- Attackers use GHDB queries to gather critical information about a target, such as exposed files, sensitive directories, and devices that are potentially vulnerable to exploitation. This helps attackers map out the target's infrastructure.

### 2. **Exploiting Misconfigurations**

- By identifying sensitive information that is exposed due to misconfigured web servers, databases, or services, attackers can take advantage of these weaknesses. For example, if a web server exposes sensitive backup files or database dumps, attackers can use that data to compromise the system.

### 3. **Finding Vulnerable Systems**

- Attackers can find systems running outdated or vulnerable software versions using GHDB. Many public-facing services, such as web servers and routers, may reveal version information in their headers or error messages. Knowing the software version allows attackers to search for known vulnerabilities and exploit them.

### 4. **Credential Harvesting**

- GHDB queries can expose sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or even unsecured configuration files. Attackers can use this data for credential stuffing (trying exposed usernames and passwords on other sites) or brute force attacks (trying various password combinations until successful).

### 5. **Identifying Open Ports and Services**

- Some GHDB queries help identify open ports and active services on a target network. This can give attackers an idea of where they can attempt entry, such as through open SSH, FTP, or web services.

### **SearchSploit for Exploit-DB**

- Attackers can also use **SearchSploit**, a command-line tool for searching **Exploit-DB** (an online database of known exploits). By downloading a local copy of Exploit-DB, attackers can perform offline searches for vulnerabilities in systems, particularly useful for assessments in networks that are isolated from the internet (air-gapped networks).

By combining GHDB queries and tools like SearchSploit, attackers gain a comprehensive set of tools for identifying weaknesses in the target's infrastructure and exploiting them for unauthorized access or further compromise.


### VPN Footprinting through Google Hacking Database
VPN footprinting is a technique used by attackers to gather information about VPN systems by searching for publicly available resources using Google hacking operators (Google dorks). These dorks can reveal login portals, configuration files, hardcoded credentials, or even vulnerabilities in VPN systems. Here's a summary of some commonly used Google dorks for VPN footprinting:

| **Google Dork**                                                                                                                                            | **Description**                                                                |

These dorks are useful for attackers to locate exposed VPN login portals, configuration files, static keys, or directories containing sensitive information. Once attackers identify vulnerable or misconfigured systems, they can proceed with further exploitation, potentially compromising the target network.

### VPN Footprinting through Google Hacking Database with AI
Attackers can leverage Al-powered technologies to enhance and automate their footprinting
tasks. With the aid of Al, attackers can perform VPN footprinting effortlessly and acquire valuable
insights.

For instance,
An attacker can use ChatGPT to perform this task by using an appropriate prompt such as:
''Use inurl search operator to obtain the Fortinet VPN login pages"

![[Pasted image 20250205235731.png]]

This command is used for performing Google Hacking through the `Lynx` browser, specifically to search for VPN login portals for Fortinet or FortiGate devices (such as SSL VPN portals). Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. **`lynx --dump`**:
    
    - This part of the command launches `Lynx`, a text-based web browser, in "dump" mode. The `--dump` flag instructs `Lynx` to display the contents of the web page in a plain text format, which is easier to process in subsequent commands.
2. **`http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:"remote+login"+fortinet+OR+fortigate+OR+"ssl+vpn"`**:
    
    - This is the Google search query that `Lynx` will access. The query is:
        - `inurl:"remote login"`: This restricts results to URLs containing the phrase "remote login."
        - `fortinet OR fortigate OR "ssl vpn"`: This filters the results to include pages related to Fortinet, FortiGate, or SSL VPN.
    - So, the query searches Google for URLs related to VPN login pages for Fortinet or FortiGate devices.
3. **`| grep "http"`**:
    
    - The output of `Lynx --dump` is then passed through the `grep` command, which searches for lines containing the string "http". This filters the results to only show URLs (as they start with "http").
4. **`| cut -d "=" -f2`**:
    
    - This command takes the filtered URLs and splits them at the "=" character. The `-f2` option tells the `cut` command to keep only the second part of the split string, which will be the actual URL after the query string in the Google search result.
5. **`| grep -o "http[^&]*"`**:
    
    - This command further filters the output by extracting just the URLs that start with "http" and end before any "&" (to avoid query parameters and only retain the base URLs).
6. **`> reconl.txt`**:
    
    - Finally, the output of all these commands is redirected into a file named `reconl.txt`. This file will contain all the extracted URLs of VPN login portals related to Fortinet and FortiGate devices.



## Footprinting through SHODAN Search Engine

**Shodan** is a search engine designed specifically for discovering devices connected to the internet, such as servers, routers, webcams, industrial control systems, IoT devices, and more. Unlike traditional search engines like Google, which index websites and content, Shodan focuses on finding devices based on their IP address, open ports, services, software, and even vulnerabilities.

![[Pasted image 20250206001141.png]]

### Other Techniques for Footprinting through Search Engines

- Gathering Information Using Google Advanced Search, Advanced Image Search, and Reverse Image Search 
  Google's **Advanced Search** allows users to refine their search by specifying multiple criteria, making it easier to find precise information without needing to remember complex search operators. Instead of typing out advanced search commands, you can fill out fields to match specific terms, phrases, or types of content. This method helps you search for:

    - Websites linked to the target organization, revealing affiliates or partners.
    - Images of the target, such as company logos, employee photos, or locations.

	To access it, click "Settings" on Google’s homepage and select **Advanced Search**, or go directly to [Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search). It allows you to combine search terms with "AND" (all must match) or "OR" (any can match). This makes it a useful tool for footprinting and gathering detailed information from the web.

![[Pasted image 20250206001359.png]]
To perform an advanced image search in Google, type
https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search in the address bar. Advanced image
search allows you to tweak your image search in a number of ways. You can search based
on image color, domain, file type, size, keyword, and so on. To do this, you choose a field.
Then, enter the string you want to search for in the field's text box and click on the
Advanced Search button.
