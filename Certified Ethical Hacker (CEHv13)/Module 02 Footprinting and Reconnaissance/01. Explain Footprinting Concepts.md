## Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance (also known as footprinting) refers to the preparatory phase where an attacker seeks to gather as much information as possible about a target of evaluation prior to launching an attack.

### Types of Reconnaissance

1. **Passive**
   - Gathering information about the target *without direct interaction*
   - It involves:
    - Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering
	- Proprietary databases and paid services
	- Sharing intelligence with partner organizations or industry groups
2. **Active**
   - Gathering information about the target *[with direct interaction]()*
   - It involves:
	 - DNS interrogation
	 - Social Engineering
	 - Network/Port Scanning
	 - User and service enumeration

## Information Obtained In Footprinting

Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target organization to identify potential vulnerabilities. Below are key categories of information collected during footprinting.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Organization Information**

- Employee details
- Telephone numbers
- Branch and location details
- Background of the organization
- Web technologies used
- News articles, press releases, and related documents

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Information**

- Domain and sub-domains
- Network blocks
- Network topology, trusted routers, and firewalls
- IP addresses of reachable systems
- WHOIS records
- DNS records

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ System Information**

- Web server OS
- Location of web servers
- Publicly available email addresses
- Usernames and passwords

---

### Footprinting Threats

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Social Engineering**

Attackers manipulate people into **revealing confidential information** without using technical hacking methods.  
üîπ Example: A hacker calls an employee, pretending to be IT support, and tricks them into sharing login credentials.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ System and Network Attacks**

By collecting details about **operating systems, software, and configurations**, attackers can find and exploit vulnerabilities.  
üîπ Example: If an attacker discovers a server is running outdated software, they can use known exploits to gain access.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Information Leakage**

Sensitive data, such as emails, financial records, or login credentials, can **leak online or through unsecured systems**.  
üîπ Example: A company‚Äôs internal documents are mistakenly uploaded to a public website, giving attackers useful intelligence.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy Loss**

Hackers can gain **unauthorized access to private data**, including customer information, employee records, and financial details.  
üîπ Example: A hacker gets access to an employee database and sells personal information on the dark web.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Corporate Espionage**

Competitors can use footprinting to **steal business strategies and trade secrets**.  
üîπ Example: A rival company gathers details about an upcoming product launch and releases a similar product before the original company.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Business Loss**

Cyberattacks resulting from footprinting can cause **financial losses, reputational damage, and legal troubles**.  
üîπ Example: A hacker gains access to an e-commerce website, disrupts transactions, and causes major revenue loss.

---

### **Conclusion**

Footprinting helps ethical hackers find vulnerabilities before attackers do. However, if misused, it can lead to **data breaches, financial damage, and loss of competitive advantage**. Organizations must take preventive measures like **awareness training, network security, and access control** to protect themselves.

## Footprinting Methodology

![[Pasted image 20250205231206.png]]

The **footprinting methodology** is a structured process used to gather information about a target organization to identify potential vulnerabilities. This process involves **collecting data from publicly available sources**, such as websites, social media, and databases. Attackers or ethical hackers follow this procedure to learn about the target's infrastructure, personnel, and other important details.
