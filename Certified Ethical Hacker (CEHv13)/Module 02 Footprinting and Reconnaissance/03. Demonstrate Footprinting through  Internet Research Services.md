# Footprinting through Internet Research Services

This section aims to familiarize you with finding the target company's top-level domains, sub-
domains, and geographical location, performing people search on people search services,
gathering information from job sites, financial services, third-party data repositories, performing
dark web footprinting, gathering competitive intelligence, etc.

## Finding a Company's Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and Sub-domains

### **Understanding the Importance of TLDs and Sub-Domains in Cybersecurity**

A company’s top-level domains (TLDs) and sub-domains can provide valuable information to attackers. Public websites serve as an organization’s digital presence, offering details on history, services, and contacts. These sites are indexed by search engines like Google and Bing, making them easily accessible.

#### **Risks Associated with Sub-Domains**

Unlike public websites, sub-domains are often used for internal testing and restricted access. These may contain sensitive information, such as source code or internal documents, making them a prime target for cyber threats. Attackers can exploit insecure sub-domains to gain insights into an organization’s structure and operations. Many companies follow common naming conventions for sub-domains, allowing attackers to discover them through trial and error or tools like Netcraft.

#### **Methods to Identify Sub-Domains**

Attackers can use search operators like:

```plaintext
site:microsoft.com -inurl:www
```

This command helps identify non-public sub-domains related to a domain.

### **Tools for Sub-Domain Discovery**

Several online tools assist in mapping an organization’s sub-domains, including:

- **Netcraft** ([netcraft.com](https://www.netcraft.com/))
    
    - Provides internet security services and sub-domain enumeration.
- **DNSdumpster** ([dnsdumpster.com](https://dnsdumpster.com/))
    
    - A domain research tool for discovering sub-domains, IP addresses, and DNS servers.
- **Pentest-Tools Find Subdomains** ([pentest-tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/))
    
    - Reveals sub-domains, IP addresses, operating systems, server details, and web technologies.

Understanding these risks and securing sub-domains can help organizations protect sensitive information from cyber threats.
