# Footprinting through Internet Research Services

This section aims to familiarize you with finding the target company's top-level domains, sub-
domains, and geographical location, performing people search on people search services,
gathering information from job sites, financial services, third-party data repositories, performing
dark web footprinting, gathering competitive intelligence, etc.

## Finding a Company's Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and Sub-domains

---

### **Understanding the Importance of TLDs and Sub-Domains in Cybersecurity**

A company’s top-level domains (TLDs) and sub-domains can provide valuable information to attackers. Public websites serve as an organization’s digital presence, offering details on history, services, and contacts. These sites are indexed by search engines like Google and Bing, making them easily accessible.

#### **Risks Associated with Sub-Domains**

Unlike public websites, sub-domains are often used for internal testing and restricted access. These may contain sensitive information, such as source code or internal documents, making them a prime target for cyber threats. Attackers can exploit insecure sub-domains to gain insights into an organization’s structure and operations. Many companies follow common naming conventions for sub-domains, allowing attackers to discover them through trial and error or tools like Netcraft.

#### **Methods to Identify Sub-Domains**

Attackers can use search operators like:

```plaintext
site:microsoft.com -inurl:www
```

This command helps identify non-public sub-domains related to a domain.

### **Tools for Sub-Domain Discovery**

Several online tools assist in mapping an organization’s sub-domains, including:

- **Netcraft** ([netcraft.com](https://www.netcraft.com/))
    
    - Provides internet security services and sub-domain enumeration.
- **DNSdumpster** ([dnsdumpster.com](https://dnsdumpster.com/))
    
    - A domain research tool for discovering sub-domains, IP addresses, and DNS servers.
- **Pentest-Tools Find Subdomains** ([pentest-tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/))
    
    - Reveals sub-domains, IP addresses, operating systems, server details, and web technologies.

Understanding these risks and securing sub-domains can help organizations protect sensitive information from cyber threats.

### Finding a Company's Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and Sub-domains with AI

An attacker can also leverage Al-powered ChatGPT or other generative Al technology to perform this task by using appropriate prompts such as
1. "Discover all the subdomains of 'google.com' using dig command"
2. "Use Sublist3r to gather a list of subdomains of the target organization eccouncil"

#### Example #1
An attacker can use ChatGPT to perform this task by using an appropriate prompt such as:
**"Discover all the subdomains of 'google.com' using dig command."**

Let's break down the command step by step:

```csharp
dig +short google.com NS |
grep -E 'CNAME|A|AAAA' |
xargs -I() dig +nocmd +noall +answer @() google.com
```

### Explanation:

1. **`dig +short google.com NS`**
    
    - `dig` is a command-line tool used to query DNS records.
    - `+short` option makes the output concise.
    - `google.com NS` queries the **Name Server (NS) records** for `google.com`, which returns the authoritative name servers.
2. **`grep -E 'CNAME|A|AAAA'`**
    
    - `grep -E` enables extended regular expressions.
    - It filters the output to only include lines that match `CNAME`, `A`, or `AAAA` (these are DNS record types:
        - `CNAME`: Canonical Name (alias records).
        - `A`: IPv4 address.
        - `AAAA`: IPv6 address.
3. **`xargs -I() dig +nocmd +noall +answer @() google.com`**
    
    - `xargs -I()` replaces `()` with the input from the previous command.
    - It runs `dig +nocmd +noall +answer @() google.com` for each name server found in step 1.
    - `dig +nocmd +noall +answer @()` queries the name server (`@()`) directly for `google.com`, returning only the final answer section.

### What This Command Does:

- Finds the authoritative name servers for `google.com`.
- Filters out only the ones that match `CNAME`, `A`, or `AAAA` records.
- Queries those name servers directly for `google.com` to get concise DNS responses.

This command is useful for troubleshooting and verifying how different name servers resolve `google.com`.
