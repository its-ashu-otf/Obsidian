# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web
and mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through
the HTTP protocol. HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide
Web resources. The term hypertext stands for text containing links to other resources and
text that the readers can easily interpret. HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for HTTP communication is port 80 , though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN ) as a Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) to reach the desired website, like
www.hackthebox.com.

**FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)** is the complete domain name that specifies an exact location of a resource on the internet. It includes the hostname and the domain name, ensuring uniqueness across the web.

### **Structure of an FQDN**

An FQDN follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **Hostname** â€“ The specific name of a system or service (e.g., `www` for a web server).
2. **Domain Name** â€“ The registered name of the website (e.g., `hackthebox`).
3. **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** â€“ The highest level of the domain name system (e.g., `.com`).

So, for **[www.hackthebox.com](http://www.hackthebox.com/)**:

- `www` â†’ Hostname (the web server)
- `hackthebox` â†’ Domain name (registered name)
- `.com` â†’ Top-Level Domain (TLD)

### **Example of an FQDN**

- `www.google.com` (web service of Google)
- `mail.yahoo.com` (Yahoo's mail service)
- `ftp.example.org` (FTP server for example.org)

An FQDN is used in networking, DNS lookups, and SSL certificates to uniquely identify servers and services on the internet. It always ends with a **dot (`.`) in DNS records** (e.g., `www.hackthebox.com.`), but the dot is usually omitted in everyday use.

## URL

Resources over HTTP are accessed via a URL , which offers many more specifications than
simply specifying a website we want to visit. Let's look at the structure of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><b>URL</b></span>:

Here is what each component stands for:

### **Components of a URL**

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** consists of several components that define the location and access method for a web resource. Below is a breakdown of its key components:

| **Component**    | **Example**           | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheme**       | `http://`, `https://` | Identifies the protocol used for communication. Ends with `://`.                                                          |
| **User Info**    | `admin:password@`     | Optional. Contains authentication credentials (username and password), separated by `:` and followed by `@`.              |
| **Host**         | `inlanefreight.com`   | Specifies the resource location. This can be a domain name or an IP address.                                              |
| **Port**         | `:80`                 | Defines the communication port. Separated from the host by `:`. Default ports: `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS).             |
| **Path**         | `/dashboard.php`      | Specifies the exact file or directory being accessed. If omitted, the server returns a default file (e.g., `index.html`). |
| **Query String** | `?login=true`         | Begins with `?`, containing key-value pairs (e.g., `login=true`). Multiple parameters are separated by `&`.               |
| **Fragment**     | `#status`             | Refers to a section within the resource. Processed on the client-side for navigation.                                     |

### **Example URL Breakdown**

**URL:**

```
https://admin:password@inlanefreight.com:8080/dashboard.php?login=true#status
```

- **Scheme** â†’ `https://`
- **User Info** â†’ `admin:password@`
- **Host** â†’ `inlanefreight.com`
- **Port** â†’ `:8080`
- **Path** â†’ `/dashboard.php`
- **Query String** â†’ `?login=true`
- **Fragment** â†’ `#status`

### **Key Takeaways**

- The **Scheme** and **Host** are mandatory.
- Other components like **User Info, Port, Path, Query String, and Fragment** are optional.
- If no port is specified, HTTP defaults to **80** and HTTPS to **443**.
- Fragments are used for navigation within the same webpage.

Not all components are required to access a resource. The main mandatory fields are the
scheme and the host, without which the request would have no resource to request.
