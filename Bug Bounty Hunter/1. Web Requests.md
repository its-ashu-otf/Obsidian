# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web
and mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through
the HTTP protocol. HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide
Web resources. The term hypertext stands for text containing links to other resources and
text that the readers can easily interpret. HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for HTTP communication is port 80 , though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites.
