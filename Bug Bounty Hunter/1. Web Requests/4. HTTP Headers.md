We have seen examples of HTTP requests and response headers in the previous section.
Such HTTP headers pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are
only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common
to both.

Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated
by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

1. General Headers
2. Entity Headers
3. Request Headers
4. Response Headers
5. Security Headers

Let's discuss each of these categories.

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between clients (browsers, scripts) and servers to pass information about requests and responses. Let's break down each type of header with explanations and examples.

---

## **1️⃣ General Headers**

These headers apply to both requests and responses but **do not relate to the data itself**.

### **Examples:**

🔹 `Cache-Control`: Controls caching behaviour.

```http
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

🔹 `Connection`: Manages connection behaviour.

```http
Connection: keep-alive
```

🔹 `Date`: The date/time the request or response was created.

```http
Date: Tue, 05 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT
```

---

## **2️⃣ Entity Headers**

These headers provide information **about the content (entity body)** of a request or response.

### **Examples:**

🔹 `Content-Type`: Specifies the type of content.

```http
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

🔹 `Media-Type`: Specifies the **Media-Type** (or **MIME-Type**) is specified using the **`Content-Type`** header in HTTP requests and responses. It tells the server (or client) what kind of data is being sent or expected.

```http
Media-Type: application/pdf
```

🔹 `Content-Length`: Specifies the length of the content in bytes.

```http
Content-Length: 4567
```

🔹 `Content-Encoding`: Specifies encoding (e.g., gzip, deflate).

```http
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

🔹 `Last-Modified`: Indicates the last modification date of a resource.

```http
Last-Modified: Wed, 10 Jan 2025 14:00:00 GMT
```

---

## **3️⃣ Request Headers**

These headers are sent **by the client (browser, script, or curl)** to the server.

### **Examples:**

🔹 `User-Agent`: Identifies the client (browser, bot, etc.).

```http
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
```

🔹 `Referer`: Indicates the previous page before the request.

```http
Referer: https://example.com/login
```

🔹 `Accept`: Specifies acceptable response content types.

```http
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml
```

🔹 `Authorization`: Used for authentication.

```http
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

🔹 `Cookie`: Sends cookies to maintain sessions.

```http
Cookie: session_id=abc123xyz
```

---

## **4️⃣ Response Headers**

These headers are **sent by the server** to provide information about the response.

### **Examples:**

🔹 `Server`: Identifies the web server software.

```http
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
```

🔹 `Set-Cookie`: Sets a cookie on the client’s browser.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123abc; Path=/; HttpOnly
```

🔹 `Location`: Redirects the client to another URL.

```http
Location: https://new.example.com
```

🔹 `ETag`: Helps with caching by assigning a unique version ID to resources.

```http
ETag: "abc123"
```

---

## **5️⃣ Security Headers**

These headers **help protect web applications from security threats**.

### **Examples:**

🔹 `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Enforces HTTPS.

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

🔹 `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: Prevents XSS by restricting allowed content sources.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
```

🔹 `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking by blocking iframes.

```http
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

🔹 `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME-type sniffing.

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

🔹 `Referrer-Policy`: Controls how much referrer information is sent.

```http
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
```
