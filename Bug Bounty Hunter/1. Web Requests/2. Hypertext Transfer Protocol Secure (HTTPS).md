In the previous section, we discussed how **HTTP** requests are sent and processed.
However, one of the significant drawbacks of HTTP is that all **data is transferred in clear-text**.
This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a Man-in-themiddle
(MiTM) attack to view the transferred data.
To counter this issue, the **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) protocol was created, **in which all**
**communications are transferred in an encrypted format**, so even if a third party does
intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason,
HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the internet, and HTTP is being
phased out, and soon most web browsers will not allow visiting HTTP websites.

## HTTPS Overview

If we examine an HTTP request, we can see the effect of not enforcing secure
communications between a web browser and a web application.

For example, the following is the content of an HTTP login request:
![[Pasted image 20250202110704.png]]

We can see that the login credentials can be viewed in clear-text. This would make it easy
for someone on the same network (such as a public wireless network) to capture the request
and reuse the credentials for malicious purposes.
In contrast, when someone intercepts and analyses traffic from an HTTPS request, they
would see something like the following:

![[Pasted image 20250202110918.png]]

As we can see, the data is transferred as a single encrypted stream, which makes it very
difficult for anyone to capture information such as credentials or any other sensitive data.
Websites that enforce HTTPS can be identified through https:// in their URL (e.g.
https://www.google.com), as well as the lock icon in the address bar of the web browser, to
the left of the URL:

![[Pasted image 20250202111044.png]]

So, if we visit a website that utilizes HTTPS, like Google, all traffic would be encrypted.

**Note:** Although the data transferred through the HTTPS protocol may be encrypted, the
request may still reveal the visited URL if it contacted a clear-text DNS server. For this
reason, it is recommended to utilize encrypted DNS servers (e.g. 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1), or
utilize a VPN service to ensure all traffic is properly encrypted.

## HTTPS Flow

Let's look at how HTTPS operates at a high level:

### **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**

When a user enters `http://example.com` instead of `https://example.com`, the browser first attempts to access the website **over HTTP (port 80)**. However, if the website enforces HTTPS, the following steps occur:

1. **Initial HTTP Request**
    
    - The browser resolves the domain and sends an **unencrypted request** to port **80**.
2. **Server Redirection**
    
    - The server detects the HTTP request and responds with a **301 Moved Permanently** status code.
    - This instructs the browser to **redirect to HTTPS (port 443)**.
3. **HTTPS Handshake Process**  
    Once redirected, the browser and server initiate a **secure connection** using TLS (Transport Layer Security):
    
    - **Client Hello** â†’ The browser sends a **"client hello"** packet, including supported encryption protocols.
    - **Server Hello** â†’ The server responds with a **"server hello"**, selecting a compatible encryption protocol.
    - **Key Exchange & Certificate Verification**
        - The server provides an **SSL/TLS certificate** to authenticate itself.
        - The browser verifies the certificate and may send a key for encrypted communication.
    - **TLS Handshake Completion** â†’ Once encryption is established, **secure HTTPS communication** begins.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** This process ensures that all subsequent HTTP traffic is **encrypted**, protecting data from interception.

### **Security Risks: HTTP Downgrade Attacks**

An attacker may attempt to **downgrade HTTPS to HTTP** using a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack**:
- The attacker sets up a **proxy** to intercept and modify traffic.
- They force the browser to **connect over HTTP instead of HTTPS**, exposing sensitive data in plaintext.

ðŸš€ **Modern security measures** like **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** and browser security policies help prevent such attacks.

### **Key Takeaways**

âœ… Websites enforcing HTTPS **redirect** HTTP traffic using **301 Moved Permanently**.  
âœ… TLS Handshake ensures **encryption and secure communication**.  
âœ… **HTTP downgrade attacks** can expose sensitive data but are mitigated by **HSTS** and modern security features.

## cURL for HTTPS

cURL should automatically handle all HTTPS communication standards and perform a
secure handshake and then encrypt and decrypt data automatically. However, if we ever
contact a website with an invalid SSL certificate or an outdated one, then cURL by default
would not proceed with the communication to protect against the earlier mentioned MITM
attacks:

```bash
curl https://inlanefreight.com
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: Invalid certificate chain
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
...SNIP...
```

Modern web browsers would do the same, warning the user against visiting a website with
an invalid SSL certificate.
We may face such an issue when testing a local web application or with a web application
hosted for practice purposes, as such web applications may not yet have implemented a
valid SSL certificate. To skip the certificate check with cURL, we can use the -k flag:

```bash

```

As we can see, the request went through this time, and we received the response data.
