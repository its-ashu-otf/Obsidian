In the previous section, we discussed how **HTTP** requests are sent and processed.
However, one of the significant drawbacks of HTTP is that all **data is transferred in clear-text**.
This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a Man-in-themiddle
(MiTM) attack to view the transferred data.
To counter this issue, the **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) protocol was created, **in which all**
**communications are transferred in an encrypted format**, so even if a third party does
intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason,
HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the internet, and HTTP is being
phased out, and soon most web browsers will not allow visiting HTTP websites.

## HTTPS Overview

If we examine an HTTP request, we can see the effect of not enforcing secure
communications between a web browser and a web application.

For example, the following is the content of an HTTP login request:

We can see that the login credentials can be viewed in clear-text. This would make it easy
for someone on the same network (such as a public wireless network) to capture the request
and reuse the credentials for malicious purposes.
In contrast, when someone intercepts and analyses traffic from an HTTPS request, they
would see something like the following:
