In the previous section, we discussed how **HTTP** requests are sent and processed.
However, one of the significant drawbacks of HTTP is that all **data is transferred in clear-text**.
This means that anyone between the source and destination can perform a Man-in-themiddle
(MiTM) attack to view the transferred data.
To counter this issue, the **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) protocol was created, **in which all**
**communications are transferred in an encrypted format**, so even if a third party does
intercept the request, they would not be able to extract the data out of it. For this reason,
HTTPS has become the mainstream scheme for websites on the internet, and HTTP is being
phased out, and soon most web browsers will not allow visiting HTTP websites.
