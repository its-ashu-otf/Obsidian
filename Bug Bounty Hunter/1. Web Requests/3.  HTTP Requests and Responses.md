HTTP communications mainly consist of an HTTP request and an HTTP response. An HTTP
request is made by the client (e.g. cURL/browser), and is processed by the server (e.g. web
server). The requests contain all of the details we require from the server, including the
resource (e.g. URL, path, parameters), any request data, headers or options we specify, and
many other options we will discuss throughout this module. Once the server receives the HTTP request, it processes it and responds by sending the HTTP response, which contains the response code, as discussed in a later section, and may contain the resource data if the requester has access to it.

## HTTP Request 
Let's start by examining the following example HTTP request:

The image above shows an HTTP GET request to the URL:
	`http://inlanefreight.com/users/login.html`
The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields 'separated by spaces':

**Understanding the Structure of an HTTP Request**

An HTTP request consists of multiple components that allow clients to communicate with a server. The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields, separated by spaces:

### 1. **Request Line**

The request line includes the following fields:

|Field|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Method**|`GET`|Specifies the action to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).|
|**Path**|`/users/login.html`|Indicates the resource being accessed. It may also include a query string (e.g., `?username=user`).|
|**Version**|`HTTP/1.1`|Specifies the HTTP version being used.|

### 2. **HTTP Headers**

Following the request line, HTTP headers are sent as key-value pairs. These headers provide additional information about the request. Common headers include:

- **Host** – Specifies the target server (e.g., `Host: inlanefreight.com`).
- **User-Agent** – Identifies the client making the request.
- **Cookie** – Contains session data or user-specific information.
- Other possible headers include `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, and `Accept-Encoding`.

Each header is terminated with a new line. This is necessary for the server to validate the request.

### 3. **Request Body (Optional)**

For methods like `POST` and `PUT`, the request may include a body containing data, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

### **HTTP Versions and Communication**

- **HTTP/1.x**: Uses clear-text communication and separates requests with new-line characters.
- **HTTP/2.x**: Sends requests in a binary format using a dictionary structure, improving efficiency and speed.

### **Example Request**

```
GET /users/login.html HTTP/1.1
Host: inlanefreight.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Cookie: sessionid=abcd1234

(Request body, if applicable)
```

Understanding these components is essential for working with web technologies, debugging network issues, and enhancing security practices.
