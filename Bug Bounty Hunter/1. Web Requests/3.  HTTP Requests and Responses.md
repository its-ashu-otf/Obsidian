HTTP communications mainly consist of an HTTP request and an HTTP response. An HTTP
request is made by the client (e.g. cURL/browser), and is processed by the server (e.g. web
server). The requests contain all of the details we require from the server, including the
resource (e.g. URL, path, parameters), any request data, headers or options we specify, and
many other options we will discuss throughout this module. Once the server receives the HTTP request, it processes it and responds by sending the HTTP response, which contains the response code, as discussed in a later section, and may contain the resource data if the requester has access to it.

## HTTP Request 
Let's start by examining the following example HTTP request:

![[Pasted image 20250202112609.png]]

The image above shows an HTTP GET request to the URL:
	`http://inlanefreight.com/users/login.html`
The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields 'separated by spaces':

**Understanding the Structure of an HTTP Request**

An HTTP request consists of multiple components that allow clients to communicate with a server. The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields, separated by spaces:

### 1. **Request Line**

The request line includes the following fields:

| Field       | Example             | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**  | `GET`               | The HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of<br>action to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).                     |
| **Path**    | `/users/login.html` | The path to the resource being accessed. This field<br>can also be suffixed with a query string (e.g. ?<br>`username=user` ). |
| **Version** | `HTTP/1.1`          | Specifies the HTTP version being used.                                                                                        |

### 2. **HTTP Headers**

Following the request line, HTTP headers are sent as key-value pairs. These headers provide additional information about the request. Common headers include:

- **Host** – Specifies the target server (e.g., `Host: inlanefreight.com`).
- **User-Agent** – Identifies the client making the request.
- **Cookie** – Contains session data or user-specific information.
- Other possible headers include `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, and `Accept-Encoding`.

Each header is terminated with a new line. This is necessary for the server to validate the request.

### 3. **Request Body (Optional)**

For methods like `POST` and `PUT`, the request may include a body containing data, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

### **HTTP Versions and Communication**

- **HTTP/1.x**: Uses clear-text communication and separates requests with new-line characters.
- **HTTP/2.x**: Sends requests in a binary format using a dictionary structure, improving efficiency and speed.

### **Example Request**

```
GET /users/login.html HTTP/1.1
Host: inlanefreight.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Cookie: sessionid=abcd1234

(Request body, if applicable)
```

Understanding these components is essential for working with web technologies, debugging network issues, and enhancing security practices.

## HTTP Response
Once the server processes our request, it sends its response. The following is an example
HTTP response:

![[Pasted image 20250205222815.png]]

The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields separated by spaces. The first being
the `HTTP version` (e.g. `HTTP/1.1` ), and the second denotes the `HTTP response code`
(e.g. `200 OK` ).

Response codes are used to determine the request's status, as will be discussed in a later
section. After the first line, the response lists its headers, similar to an HTTP request. Both
request and response headers are discussed in the next section.

Finally, the response may end with a response body, which is separated by a new line after
the headers. The response body is usually defined as `HTML` code. However, it can also
respond with other code types such as `JSON` , website resources such as images, style
sheets or scripts, or even a document such as a PDF document hosted on the webserver.

## **HTTP Response Structure**

An HTTP response consists of multiple components that inform the client about the result of their request.

### 1. **Response Line**

The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields separated by spaces:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Field|Example|Description|
|**Version**|`HTTP/1.1`|Specifies the HTTP version used.|
|**Status Code**|`200 OK`|Indicates the status of the request (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).|

Response codes help determine whether a request was successful, redirected, or encountered an error. A more detailed discussion on response codes will be covered in a later section.

### 2. **Response Headers**

Following the response line, headers provide additional information about the response, similar to HTTP request headers. Common response headers include:

- **Content-Type** – Specifies the format of the response body (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
    
- **Content-Length** – Indicates the size of the response body.
    
- **Set-Cookie** – Used to set cookies on the client side.
    

Each header is terminated with a new line.

### 3. **Response Body**

After the headers, a blank line separates them from the response body, which contains the actual content returned by the server. The response body is commonly HTML but may also include:

- **JSON** – Used for API responses and structured data.
    
- **Images, Stylesheets, or Scripts** – Various web resources like CSS or JavaScript files.
    
- **Documents** – Files such as PDFs or other formats hosted on the webserver.

#### **Example Response:**

```html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1256

<html>
<head><title>Welcome</title></head>
<body><h1>Welcome to the site!</h1></body>
</html>
```

## cURL

`curl` (short for **Client URL**) is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. It supports various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SCP, SFTP, LDAP, and more.

### 🔹 **Key Features of `curl`**

✅ Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SCP, etc.)  
✅ Works without user interaction (ideal for scripting)  
✅ Handles authentication, cookies, and sessions  
✅ Supports proxy servers and tunneling  
✅ Can download and upload files

### 🔹 **Basic Usage of `curl`**

#### 1️⃣ **Fetching a Web Page**

```bash
curl https://example.com
```

This fetches and displays the HTML of `example.com`.

#### 2️⃣ **Downloading a File**

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-O` option saves the file with its original name.

#### 3️⃣ **Saving Output to a File**

```bash
curl -o output.html https://example.com
```

This saves the response to `output.html`.

#### 4️⃣ **Sending a POST Request**

```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=ashu&password=123" https://example.com/login
```

The `-X` option specifies the request method, and `-d` sends form data.

#### 5️⃣ **Using Authentication**

```bash
curl -u username:password https://example.com/private
```

The `-u` flag is for basic authentication.

#### 6️⃣ **Downloading Multiple Files**

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file1.zip -O https://example.com/file2.zip
```

#### 7️⃣ **Checking Response Headers**

```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```

The `-I` option fetches only headers.

#### 8️⃣ **Using a Proxy Server**

```bash
curl -x http://proxyserver:port https://example.com
```

This routes the request through a proxy.

### 🔹 **Why Use `curl`?**

- **Scripting & Automation**: Ideal for DevOps, penetration testing, and data fetching.
- **Testing APIs**: Quickly test REST API endpoints.
- **Fetching Remote Data**: Great for scraping or downloading files.

In our earlier examples with cURL, we only specified the URL and got the response body in
return. However, cURL also allows us to preview the full HTTP request and the full HTTP
response, which can become very handy when performing web penetration tests or writing
exploits. To view the full HTTP request and response, we can simply add the -v verbose
flag to our earlier commands, and it should print both the request and response:

```bash
curl inlanefreight.com -v
```

```html
* Trying SERVER_IP:80...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to inlanefreight.com (SERVER_IP) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: inlanefreight.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.65.3
> Accept: */*
>> Connection: close
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< Date: Tue, 21 Jul 2020 05:20:15 GMT
< Server: Apache/X.Y.ZZ (Ubuntu)
< WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Restricted Content"
< Content-Length: 464
<< Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
...SNIP...****
```

As we can see, this time, we get the full HTTP request and response. The request simply
sent`GET / HTTP/1.1` along with the `Host` , User-Agent and Accept headers. In return,
the HTTP response contained the HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized , which indicates that we do
not have access over the requested resource, as we will see in an upcoming section. Similar
to the request, the response also contained several headers sent by the server, including
Date , Content-Length , and Content-Type . Finally, the response contained the response
body in HTML, which is the same one we received earlier when using cURL without the -v
flag.
Exercise: The -vvv flag shows an even more verbose output. Try to use this flag to see
what extra request and response details get displayed with it.
