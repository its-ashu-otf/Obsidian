HTTP communications mainly consist of an HTTP request and an HTTP response. An HTTP
request is made by the client (e.g. cURL/browser), and is processed by the server (e.g. web
server). The requests contain all of the details we require from the server, including the
resource (e.g. URL, path, parameters), any request data, headers or options we specify, and
many other options we will discuss throughout this module. Once the server receives the HTTP request, it processes it and responds by sending the HTTP response, which contains the response code, as discussed in a later section, and may contain the resource data if the requester has access to it.
