***OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection****, where open stands to say non-proprietary. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. The OSI reference model was developed by ***ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization**, in the year 1984.

The OSI model provides a ***theoretical foundation** for understanding ***network communication****. However, it is usually not directly implemented in its entirety in real-world ***networking hardware** or ***software**. Instead, ***specific protocols** and ***technologies*** are often designed based on the principles outlined in the ***OSI model** to facilitate efficient data transmission and networking operations


> [!NOTE] NOTE:
> OSI Model is a Theoretical Model. 


It is divided into ***seven layers that work together** to carry out specialised ***network functions**, allowing for a more systematic approach to networking.

## What are the 7 layers of the OSI Model?

The seven abstraction layers of the OSI model can be defined as follows, from top to bottom:

#### 7. The application layer

![The Application Layer: content requested and returned in required format](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2rcDKpr4WLqoyAZ7GDKkyJ/7cab96402de7ac5465b86e617da3da4e/osi_model_application_layer_7.png "The Application Layer")

This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user.

Application layer protocols include [HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) as well as [SMTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/) (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables [email](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email/) communications).

> ***Note:** The application Layer is also called Desktop Layer.

## What is layer 7 of the Internet?

Layer 7 refers to the top layer in the 7-layer [OSI Model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) of the Internet. It is also known as the "application layer." It is the top layer of the data processing that occurs just below the surface or behind the scenes of the software applications that users interact with. The [HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) requests and responses used to load webpages, for example, are layer 7 events.

[DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) that take place at this level are known as layer 7 attacks or application layer attacks. DDoS attacks can also take place at [layers 3](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/layer-3-ddos-attacks/) or 4 of the OSI Model.

## How does layer 7 interact with the other OSI layers?

Data from layer 7 gets passed down the stack, although layer 7 only interacts with layer 6. As data goes down through the stack, it is broken up into [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/), and certain layers add headers and footers to each packet – for example, at layer 3, an IP header containing the destination and source [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) is added to each packet. At the bottom of the stack, data is converted into bits and transmitted across the physical Internet.

Upon reaching its destination, data goes back up the stack, starting at layer 1. At each layer, header and footer data is interpreted and stripped, and data is put into a form that is usable for the next layer up. Once data reaches layer 7 on the other side, it is made available to applications. (Despite all these steps, the whole process takes only milliseconds.)

Crucial to understanding how the OSI Model works is the fact that each layer only communicates with that same layer on the other end of the interaction. Layer 7 data is only interpreted by layer 7 on the receiving end of the communication; the other layers on the receiving end merely pass the data up to layer 7. Similarly, the IP header data that is appended to data packets in layer 3 on one side is only read and interpreted by layer 3 on the other side.
#### 6. The presentation layer

![The Presentation Layer: encryption, compression, translation](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/19L86neKKT8srUkOSe4rf7/ff4c91c94a1790651df7b48433913f59/osi_model_presentation_layer_6.png "The Presentation Layer")

This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/), and compression of data.

Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.

If the devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, layer 6 is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver's end so that it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.

Finally the presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of data that will be transferred.

> Note: ***Device or Protocol Use:**  JPEG, MPEG, GIF.
#### 5. The session layer

![The Session Layer: session of communication](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/29mRrgK22AqJVlg2MMlD86/34d8f4071b6cc0d3b03c93f55e4d89b7/osi_model_session_layer_5.png "The Session Layer")

This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.

The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints. For example, if a 100 megabyte file is being transferred, the session layer could set a checkpoint every 5 megabytes. In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.

> **NOTE:**
> - All the below 3 layers(including Session Layer) are integrated as a single layer in the [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model) model as the “Application Layer”.
> - Implementation of these 3 layers is done by the network application itself. These are also known as ***Upper Layers or*** ***Software Layers.**
> - **Device or Protocol Use :**  NetBIOS, PPTP.

#### 4. The transport layer

![The Transport Layer: segment, transport, reassembly](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3OlO75NcADGL3SmEADFDqd/723b8c7639c4e2e6b4febcbe7fd36e0e/osi_model_transport_layer_4.png "The Transport Layer")

Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. The transport layer on the receiving device is responsible for reassembling the segments into data the session layer can consume.

The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control determines an optimal speed of transmission to ensure that a sender with a fast connection does not overwhelm a receiver with a slow connection. The transport layer performs error control on the receiving end by ensuring that the data received is complete, and requesting a retransmission if it isn’t.

Transport layer protocols include the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) and the [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/).

> ***Note:** The sender needs to know the port number associated with the receiver’s application. 
>
	Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually. For example, when a web application requests a web server, it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications. Many applications have default ports assigned.
	- Data in the Transport Layer is called ***Segments****.
	- Transport layer is operated by the Operating System. It is a part of the OS and communicates with the Application Layer by making system calls.
	- The transport layer is called as ***Heart of the OSI** model.
	- ***Device or Protocol Use :*** TCP, UDP  NetBIOS, PPTP


#### 3. The network layer

![The Network Layer: packets creation, transport, packets assembly](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3g2Hv0frHsql5SFauJL5EG/d8cede7b6a780e63413bd86de9eee7f9/osi_model_network_layer_3.png "The Network Layer")

The [network layer](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/) is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/), on the sender’s device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as [routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/).

Network layer protocols include IP, the [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/), the [Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-igmp/), and the [IPsec](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/) suite.

> **NOTE:**
> - Segment in the Network layer is referred to as ***Packet****.
>-  Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers and switches. 
#### 2. The data link layer

![The Data Link Layer: frame creation, frames sent between networks](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3TLHavXiotb9ayyZFKECf3/9456d1c431cd71ceea7f4b407f076f11/data_link_layer_osi_model.png "The Data Link Layer")

The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the _same_ network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).

> **NOTE:**
> - Packet in the Data Link layer is referred to as ***Frame.**
> - Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines.
> - Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
#### 1. The physical layer

![The Physical Layer: sending cable, bitstream, receiving cable](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1HQ1W5P4XAinIdM37DTu4U/900ccdceda346baf03ce8b9f977d2974/osi_model_physical_layer_1.png "The Physical Layer")

This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and [switches](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/). This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.

> **NOTE:***
> - Hub, Repeater, Modem, and Cables are Physical Layer devices.
> - Network Layer, Data Link Layer, and Physical Layer are also known as ***Lower Layers** or **Hardware Layers**.

## Why Does The OSI Model Matter?

Even though the modern Internet doesn’t strictly use the OSI Model (it uses a simpler Internet protocol suite), the OSI Model is still very helpful for solving network problems. Whether it’s one person having trouble getting their laptop online, or a website being down for thousands of users, the OSI Model helps to identify the problem. If you can narrow down the issue to one specific layer of the model, you can avoid a lot of unnecessary work.

### Is OSI layer still used?

> Yes, the ***OSI model*** is still used by **networking professionals*** to understand data abstraction paths and processes better.
