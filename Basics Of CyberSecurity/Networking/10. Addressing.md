## What is an IP address? How does IP addressing work?

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device or domain that connects to the Internet. Each IP address is a series of characters, such as '192.168.1.1'. Via [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) resolvers, which translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, users are able to access websites without memorizing this complex series of characters. Each IP packet will contain both the IP address of the device or domain sending the packet and the IP address of the intended recipient, much like how both the destination address and the return address are included on a piece of mail.

![IP address gets packets to their destination](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4tzfU9Y5ows0uT3u4GUlWr/9d4eaa83ce372454cc14d5fec83fb5b1/internet_protocol_ip_address_diagram.svg)

## IPv4 vs. IPv6

The fourth version of IP (IPv4 for short) was introduced in 1983. However, just as there are only so many possible permutations for automobile license plate numbers and they have to be reformatted periodically, the supply of available IPv4 addresses has become depleted. IPv6 addresses have many more characters and thus more permutations; however, IPv6 is not yet completely adopted, and most domains and devices still have IPv4 addresses. For more on IPv4 and IPv6, see [What is my IP address?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/)

## What is an IP packet?

IP packets are created by adding an IP header to each packet of data before it is sent on its way. An IP header is just a series of bits (ones and zeros), and it records several pieces of information about the packet, including the sending and receiving IP address. IP headers also report:

- Header length
- Packet length
- [Time to live (TTL)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/), or the number of network hops a packet can make before it is discarded
- Which transport protocol is being used (TCP, UDP, etc.)

In total there are 14 fields for information in IPv4 headers, although one of them is optional.

## What is an autonomous system?

[The Internet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/how-does-the-internet-work/) is a network of networks*, and autonomous systems are the big networks that make up the Internet. More specifically, an autonomous system (AS) is a large network or group of networks that has a unified [routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) policy. Every computer or device that connects to the Internet is connected to an AS.

![Autonomous systems around the world with ASNs](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2VQ6NpacA6xXz9B8iAE7re/e06c5e47d5138d05b27c208a59373a30/autonomous-system-diagram.svg)

Imagine an AS as being like a town's post office. Mail goes from post office to post office until it reaches the right town, and that town's post office will then deliver the mail within that town. Similarly, [data packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) cross the Internet by hopping from AS to AS until they reach the AS that contains their destination [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-protocol/) address. [Routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/) within that AS send the packet to the [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/).

Every AS controls a specific set of IP addresses, just as every town's post office is responsible for delivering mail to all the addresses within that town. The range of IP addresses that a given AS has control over is called their "IP address space."

Most ASes connect to several other ASes. If an AS connects to only one other AS and shares the same routing policy, it may instead be considered a subnetwork of the first AS.

Typically, each AS is operated by a single large organization, such as an Internet service provider (ISP), a large enterprise technology company, a university, or a government agency.

_*A network is a group of two or more connected computers._

## How does IP routing work?

The Internet is made up of interconnected large networks that are each responsible for certain blocks of IP addresses; these large networks are known as [autonomous systems (AS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/). A variety of routing protocols, including [BGP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/), help route packets across ASes based on their destination IP addresses. Routers have routing tables that indicate which ASes the packets should travel through in order to reach the desired destination as quickly as possible. Packets travel from AS to AS until they reach one that claims responsibility for the targeted IP address. That AS then internally routes the packets to the destination.

Protocols attach packet headers at different layers of the OSI model:

![Protocols attach packet headers at different layers of OSI model](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/6htPEWbcCRIv5FMhWKYy0m/ef16a86a38a638e8fed01c326f8211f1/protocol_headers.svg)

Packets can take different routes to the same place if necessary, just as a group of people driving to an agreed-upon destination can take different roads to get there.



## What do the different parts of an IP address mean?

This section focuses on IPv4 addresses, which are presented in the form of four decimal numbers separated by periods, like 203.0.113.112. (IPv6 addresses are longer and use letters as well as numbers.)

Every IP address has two parts. The first part indicates which network the address belongs to. The second part specifies the device within that network. However, the length of the "first part" changes depending on the network's class.

Networks are categorized into different classes, labeled A through E. Class A networks can connect millions of devices. Class B networks and Class C networks are progressively smaller in size. (Class D and Class E networks are not commonly used.)

Let's break down how these classes affect IP address construction:

**Class A network:** Everything before the first period indicates the network, and everything after it specifies the device within that network. Using 203.0.113.112 as an example, the network is indicated by "203" and the device by "0.113.112."

**Class B network:** Everything before the second period indicates the network. Again using 203.0.113.112 as an example, "203.0" indicates the network and "113.112" indicates the device within that network.

**Class C network:** For Class C networks, everything before the third period indicates the network. Using the same example, "203.0.113" indicates the Class C network, and "112" indicates the device.

# What is IPv4?

**IP** stands for **Internet Protocol** and **v4** stands for **Version Four** (IPv4). IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the ARPANET in 1983.   
IP version four addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation.   
Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address. 

#### Parts of IPv4

- **Network part:**   
    The network part indicates the distinctive variety that’s appointed to the network. The network part conjointly identifies the category of the network that’s assigned.
- **Host Part:**   
    The host part uniquely identifies the machine on your network. This part of the IPv4 address is assigned to every host.   
    For each host on the network, the network part is the same, however, the host half must vary.
- **Subnet number:**   
    This is the non-obligatory part of IPv4. Local networks that have massive numbers of hosts are divided into subnets and subnet numbers are appointed to that.

#### Characteristics of IPv4

- IPv4 could be a 32-Bit IP Address.
- IPv4 could be a numeric address, and its bits are separated by a dot.
- The number of header fields is twelve and the length of the header field is twenty.
- It has Unicast, broadcast, and multicast style of addresses.
- IPv4 supports VLSM (Virtual Length Subnet Mask).
- IPv4 uses the Post Address Resolution Protocol to map to the MAC address.
- RIP may be a routing protocol supported by the routed daemon.
- Networks ought to be designed either manually or with DHCP.
- Packet fragmentation permits from routers and causing host.

#### Advantages of IPv4

- IPv4 security permits encryption to keep up privacy and security.
- IPV4 network allocation is significant and presently has quite 85000 practical routers.
- It becomes easy to attach multiple devices across an outsized network while not NAT.
- This is a model of communication so provides quality service also as economical knowledge transfer.
- IPV4 addresses are redefined and permit flawless encoding.
- Routing is a lot of scalable and economical as a result of addressing is collective more effectively.
- Data communication across the network becomes a lot of specific in multicast organizations.
    - Limits net growth for existing users and hinders the use of the net for brand new users.
    - Internet Routing is inefficient in IPv4.
    - IPv4 has high System Management prices and it’s labour-intensive, complex, slow & frequent to errors.
    - Security features are non-obligatory.
    - Difficult to feature support for future desires as a result of adding it on is extremely high overhead since it hinders the flexibility to attach everything over IP.

#### Limitations of IPv4

- IP relies on network layer addresses to identify end-points on network, and each network has a unique IP address.
- The world’s supply of unique IP addresses is dwindling, and they might eventually run out theoretically.
- If there are multiple host, we need IP addresses of next class.
- Complex host and routing configuration, non-hierarchical addressing, difficult to re-numbering addresses, large routing tables, non-trivial implementations in providing security, QoS (Quality of Service), mobility and multi-homing, multicasting etc. are the big limitation of IPv4 so that’s why IPv6 came into the picture.

## IPv4 Classes


| **Class** | **Range**                   | **Subnet Mask** | Hosts Per Network ID |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Class A   | 1.0.0.0 - 126               | 255.0.0.0       | $2^{24} -2$          |
| Class B   | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0     | 255.255.0.0     | $2^{16} -2$          |
| Class C   | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0   | 255.255.255.0   | $2^{8} -2$           |
| Class D   | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 |                 |                      |
| Class E   | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 |                 |                      |

Here, 127.0.0.0 is Loopback Address and 255.0.0.0 is broadcast address.

![[Pasted image 20240623203942.jpg]]

IPv4 address structure:

- It is a 32-bit long value
- In binary, it is a 32-bit long string of ones and zeros.

> It has 4 octets, each octet 8-bit long string of ones and zeros

> Example: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

- In decimal format, it consists of 4 decimal numbers separated by a dot.

> Example: 192.134.34.11

## 5 classes of IPv4

The class of an IP address is determined by the first octet.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*W5SePMCmCz3U0PaUeR6U_Q.png)

**Class A** IP address has the first octet starting from 0, **class B** starts from 0+128 = 128. **Class C** starts from 0+128+64=192. **Class D** starts from 0+128+64+32=224. **Class E** starts from 0+128+64+32+16=240.

**Class A** ends at 127, which can be inferred from the starting end of Class B. Similarly **Class B** ends at 191, **Class C** ends at 223, **Class D** at 239, and Class E at 255.


# Meet IANA

![[Pasted image 20240623193127.jpg]]

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is a standards organization that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System, media types, and other Internet Protocol–related symbols and Internet numbers.

# Class A addresses

Class A addresses are designed for very large networks. In a Class A address, the first octet of the address is the network ID, and the remaining three octets are the host ID. Because only eight bits are allocated to the network ID and the first of these bits is used to indicate that the address is a Class A address, only 126 Class A networks can exist in the entire Internet. However, each Class A network can accommodate more than 16 million hosts.

Only about 40 Class A addresses are actually assigned to companies or organizations. The rest are either reserved for use by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or are assigned to organizations that manage IP assignments for geographic regions such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

Just for fun, Table-4 lists some of the better-known Class A networks. You'll probably recognize many of them.

You may have noticed in Table-3 that Class A addresses end with 126.x.y.z, and Class B addresses begin with 128.x.y.z. What happened to 127.x.y.z? This special range of addresses is reserved for loopback testing, so these addresses aren't assigned to public networks.

## Class B addresses

In a Class B address, the first two octets of the IP address are used as the network ID, and the second two octets are used as the host ID. Thus, a Class B address comes close to my hypothetical scheme of splitting the address down the middle, using half for the network ID and half for the host ID. It isn't identical to this scheme, however, because the first two bits of the first octet are required to be 10, in order to indicate that the address is a Class B address. As a result, a total of 16,384 Class B networks can exist. All Class B addresses fall within the range 128.x.y.z to 191.x.y.z. Each Class B address can accommodate more than 65,000 hosts.

The problem with Class B networks is that even though they are much smaller than Class A networks, they still allocate far too many host IDs. Very few networks have tens of thousands of hosts. Thus, careless assignment of Class B addresses can lead to a large percentage of the available host addresses being wasted on organizations that don't need them.

## Class C addresses

In a Class C address, the first three octets are used for the network ID, and the fourth octet is used for the host ID. With only eight bits for the host ID, each Class C network can accommodate only 254 hosts. However, with 24 network ID bits, Class C addresses allow for more than 2 million networks.

The problem with Class C networks is that they're too small. Although few organizations need the tens of thousands of host addresses provided by a Class B address, many organizations need more than a few hundred. The large discrepancy between Class B networks and Class C networks is what led to the development of subnetting, which I describe in the next section.

### Private IP Addresses

Private IP addresses are non-internet facing IP addresses used within internal networks. They are provided by network devices, such as routers, and are commonly used for local area networks in residential, office, and enterprise areas.

The 192.168.0.1 IP address is part of the class C private IP address range and is often used for home networking and Wi-Fi routers.

These IP address is not routable on Internet.

| Class | Range                         | Subnet Mask   |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| A     | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255     | 255.0.0.0     |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255   | 255.255.0.0   |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 |

### NAT
### What Is Network Address Translation (NAT)?

![What Is Network Address Translation (NAT)?](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/network-address-translation/jcr:content/Grid/category_atl_copy_co/layout-category-atl/anchor_info_8de7.img.jpg/1645604805512.jpg "What Is Network Address Translation (NAT)?")

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a service that enables private IP networks to use the internet and cloud. NAT translates private IP addresses in an internal network to a public IP address before packets are sent to an external network.
## Classless Network

A classless network, in the context of IP addressing and routing, refers to a network that uses Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). CIDR allows for a more flexible allocation of IP addresses compared to the traditional class-based (Class A, B, C) addressing system.

### Key Features of Classless Networks:

1. **Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):**
   - CIDR allows for subnet masks of varying lengths, which means that the network can be divided into subnets of different sizes based on need, rather than being restricted to the fixed sizes defined by the old class-based system.

2. **CIDR Notation:**
   - Instead of the traditional IP classes (A, B, C), CIDR uses a notation format like `192.168.1.0/24`, where `/24` indicates the number of bits in the subnet mask. This specifies that the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network part, and the remaining bits are for host addresses.

3. **Efficient IP Address Usage:**
   - CIDR helps in the efficient allocation of IP addresses, reducing the wastage associated with the traditional class-based system. It allows for IP address blocks to be allocated based on the actual number of hosts required.

4. **Aggregation and Summarization:**
   - CIDR enables route aggregation, where multiple IP networks can be represented by a single route entry. This simplifies the routing tables and improves routing efficiency.

### Example of Classless Networking:

- **CIDR Notation:** `192.168.1.0/24`
  - This indicates a network with an IP address range from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`, where `192.168.1.0` is the network address and `192.168.1.255` is the broadcast address. The `/24` means that the first 24 bits are the network part of the address, leaving 8 bits for host addresses (256 total addresses, but 254 usable for hosts).

### Benefits of Classless Networks:

1. **Scalability:**
   - Networks can be easily scaled by adjusting the subnet mask to provide more or fewer IP addresses as needed.
   
2. **Improved IP Address Utilization:**
   - Reduces the wastage of IP addresses, ensuring that IP resources are used more effectively.

3. **Simplified Routing:**
   - Enables route summarization, which reduces the size of routing tables and simplifies network management.
### Disadvantages of Classless Networks:

1. **Complexity in Configuration:**
   - Configuring and managing CIDR and VLSM can be more complex compared to classful addressing, especially for network administrators who are not familiar with the intricacies of subnetting and supernetting.

2. **Increased Management Overhead:**
   - The flexibility of creating subnets of varying sizes requires more careful planning and management to avoid overlapping subnets and ensure efficient use of IP addresses.

3. **Potential for Misconfiguration:**
   - Due to the more granular control over IP address allocation, there is a higher risk of misconfiguration. Incorrect subnet masks or improperly defined address ranges can lead to network issues and connectivity problems.

4. **Compatibility Issues:**
   - Older network devices or software that do not support CIDR may face compatibility issues. While most modern equipment supports CIDR, some legacy systems may not, leading to potential integration problems.

5. **Complexity in Route Summarization:**
   - While CIDR allows for route summarization, it also requires careful planning to implement effectively. Incorrect summarization can lead to routing inefficiencies or even routing loops.

6. **Learning Curve:**
   - Network administrators and engineers need to have a solid understanding of CIDR and VLSM concepts, which may involve a steep learning curve for those accustomed to classful networking.

### Summary:

While classless networks offer significant benefits in terms of IP address utilization and routing efficiency, they also introduce complexities and potential challenges in configuration, management, and compatibility. Network administrators must weigh these factors and ensure they have the necessary knowledge and tools to effectively manage a classless networking environment. Classless networks, through the use of CIDR, allow for more flexible and efficient IP address allocation and routing compared to the traditional class-based system. This flexibility is crucial for the scalability and efficient management of modern IP networks.

# What is IPv6?

The most common version of the Internet Protocol currently in use, IPv4, will soon be replaced by IPv6, a new version of the protocol. The well-known IPv6 protocol is being used and deployed more often, especially in mobile phone markets. IP address determines who and where you are in the network of billions of digital devices that are connected to the Internet.

IPv6 or Internet Protocol Version 6 is a network layer protocol that allows communication to take place over the network. IPv6 was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in December 1998 with the purpose of superseding IPv4 due to the global exponentially growing internet of users.

## What is IPv4?

The common type of IP address (is known as IPv4, for “version 4”). Here’s an example of what an IP address might look like:

25.59.209.224

An IPv4 address consists of four numbers, each of which contains one to three digits, with a single dot (.) separating each number or set of digits. This group of separated numbers creates the addresses that let you and everyone around the globe to send and retrieve data over our Internet connections. The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. To date, it is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic. Initially, it was assumed it would never run out of addresses but the present situation paves a new way to IPv6, let’s see why? An IPv6 address consists of eight groups of four [hexadecimal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hexadecimal-number-system/) digits. Here’s an example IPv6 address:

3001:0da8:75a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

## IPv6 vs IPv4

This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfil the need for more Internet addresses. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address space.

> IPv6 support a theoretical maximum of 340, 282, 366, 920, 938, 463, 463, 374, 607, 431, 768, 211, 456. To keep it straightforward, we will never run out of IP addresses again.

The next iteration of the IP standard is known as Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). Although IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist for a while, IPv6 is meant to work in tandem with IPv4 before eventually taking its place. We need to implement IPv6 in order to proceed and keep bringing new gadgets and services to the Internet. We can only move forward with an innovative and open Internet if we implement it, which was created with the needs of a global commercial Internet in mind.

|IPv6|IPv4|
|---|---|
|IPv6 has a 128-bit address length|IPv4 has a 32-bit address length|
|It supports Auto and renumbering address configuration|It Supports Manual and [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) address configuration|
|The address space of IPv6 is quite large it can produce 3.4×1038 address space|It can generate 4.29×109 address space|
|Address Representation of IPv6 is in hexadecimal|Address representation of IPv4 is in decimal|
|In IPv6 [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) field is not available|In IPv4 checksum field is available|
|IPv6 has a [header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6-header/) of 40 bytes fixed|IPv4 has a header of 20-60 bytes.|
|IPv6 does not support [VLSM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/).|IPv4 supports VLSM(Variable Length subnet mask).|

## Representation of IPv6

An IPv6 address consists of eight groups of four [hexadecimal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hexadecimal-number-system/) digits separated by ‘ . ‘ and each Hex digit representing four bits so the total length of IPv6 is 128 bits. Structure given below.

![IPv6-Representation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240530153304/IPv6-Represantation.png)

IPV6-Representation

`gggg.gggg.gggg.ssss.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx`

The first 48 bits represent Global Routing Prefix. The next 16 bits represent the student ID and the last 64 bits represent the host ID. The first 64 bits represent the network portion and the last 64 bits represent the interface id.

***Global Routing Prefix:** The Global Routing Prefix is the portion of an IPv6 address that is used to identify a specific network or subnet within the larger IPv6 internet. It is assigned by an ISP or a regional internet registry (RIR).

***Student Id:** The portion of the address used within an organization to identify subnets. This usually follows the Global Routing Prefix.

***Host Id:** The last part of the address, is used to identify a specific host on a network.

Example: 3001:0da8:75a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

## Types of IPv6 Address

Now that we know about what is IPv6 address let’s take a look at its different types.

- ***Unicast Addresses :** Only one interface is specified by the unicast address. A packet moves from one host to the destination host when it is sent to a unicast address destination.
- ***Multicast Addresses:** It represents a group of IP devices and can only be used as the destination of a datagram.
- ***Anycast Addresses:*** The multicast address and the anycast address are the same. The way the anycast address varies from other addresses is that it can deliver the same IP address to several servers or devices. Keep in mind that the hosts do not receive the IP address. Stated differently, multiple interfaces or a collection of interfaces are assigned an anycast address.

## Advantages

- ***Faster Speeds:** IPv6 supports multicast rather than [broadcast](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-a-broadcast-storm/) in IPv4.This feature allows bandwidth-intensive packet flows (like multimedia streams) to be sent to multiple destinations all at once.
- ***Stronger Security:** IP Security, which provides confidentiality, and data integrity, is embedded into IPv6.
- Routing efficiency
- Reliability
- Most importantly it’s the final solution for growing nodes in Global-network.
- The device allocates addresses on its own.
- Internet protocol security is used to support security.
- Enable simple aggregation of prefixes allocated to IP networks; this saves bandwidth by enabling the simultaneous transmission of large data packages.

## Disadvantages

- **Conversion:*** Due to widespread present usage of IPv4 it will take a long period to completely shift to IPv6.
- ***Communication:** IPv4 and IPv6 machines cannot communicate directly with each other.
- ***Not Going Backward Compatibility:** IPv6 cannot be executed on IPv4-capable computers because it is not available on IPv4 systems.
- ***Conversion Time:*** One significant drawback of IPv6 is its inability to uniquely identify each device on the network, which makes the conversion to IPV4 extremely time-consuming.
- Cross-protocol communication is forbidden since there is no way for IPv4 and IPv6 to communicate with each other.
