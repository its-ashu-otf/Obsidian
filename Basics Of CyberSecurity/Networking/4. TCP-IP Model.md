The TCP/IP model is a fundamental framework for computer networking. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet. This model defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices. It consists of four layers: the Link Layer, the Internet Layer, the Transport Layer, and the Application Layer. Each layer has specific functions that help manage different aspects of network communication, making it essential for understanding and working with modern networks.

TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model. In this article, we are going to discuss the TCP/IP model in detail.

## What Does TCP/IP Do?

The main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end.

## Layers of TCP/IP Model

### 1. Network Access Layer

The Network Access Layer, or Link Layer, is the first layer in the TCP/IP model. This layer is responsible for generating the data and requesting connections. It acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver. Error prevention and “framing” are also provided by this layer.
### Functions:
1. **Framing**:
   - **Data Packaging**: Converts packets from the Internet Layer into frames suitable for transmission.
   - **Frame Structure**: Each frame includes a header and a trailer that encapsulate the packet.

2. **Physical Addressing**:
   - **MAC Addresses**: Uses Media Access Control (MAC) addresses to identify devices on the same local network.
   - **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses.

3. **Error Detection and Handling**:
   - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Ensures data integrity by detecting errors in transmitted frames.
   - **Retransmission**: Requests retransmission of corrupted frames.

4. **Media Access Control**:
   - **Access Methods**: Manages how multiple devices share the same physical medium (e.g., Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) for Ethernet).
   - **Collision Handling**: Detects and resolves data collisions.

### Components:
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Hardware that connects a computer to a network.
- **Physical Media**: Cables (Ethernet, fibre optic) and wireless technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

### Examples:
- **Ethernet**: A common wired networking technology that operates at the Network Access Layer.
- **Wi-Fi**: A wireless networking technology that also functions at this layer.
### Summary:
The Network Access Layer is responsible for the physical aspects of data transmission, including framing, addressing, error detection, and media access control, ensuring data can be transmitted and received accurately over various physical mediums.

### 2. Internet Layer

This layer parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols residing at this layer are as follows:

- ***IP:** [IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address) stands for Internet Protocol and it is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host by looking at the IP addresses in the packet headers. IP has 2 versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the one that most websites are using currently. But IPv6 is growing as the number of IPv4 addresses is limited in number when compared to the number of users.
- **ICMP:*** [ICMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-icmp-and-igmp) stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is encapsulated within IP datagrams and is responsible for providing hosts with information about network problems.
- **ARP:*** [ARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works) stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Its job is to find the hardware address of a host from a known IP address. ARP has several types: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP, and Inverse ARP.

The Internet Layer is a layer in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which is the set of protocols that define the Internet. The Internet Layer is responsible for routing packets of data from one device to another across a network. It does this by assigning each device a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and determine the route that packets should take to reach it.

### 3. Transport Layer

The TCP/IP transport layer protocols exchange data receipt acknowledgments and retransmit missing packets to ensure that packets arrive in order and without error. End-to-end communication is referred to as such. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol are transport layer protocols at this level (UDP).

- **TCP:*** Applications can interact with one another using [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp) as though they were physically connected by a circuit. TCP transmits data in a way that resembles character-by-character transmission rather than separate packets. A starting point that establishes the connection, the whole transmission in byte order, and an ending point that closes the connection make up this transmission.
- **UDP:*** The datagram delivery service is provided by [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp), the other transport layer protocol. Connections between receiving and sending hosts are not verified by UDP. Applications that transport little amounts of data use UDP rather than TCP because it eliminates the processes of establishing and validating connections.

### 4. Application Layer

This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The three main protocols present in this layer are:

- ***HTTP and HTTPS:** [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https-2) stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. It is used by the World Wide Web to manage communications between web browsers and servers. HTTPS stands for HTTP-Secure. It is a combination of HTTP with SSL(Secure Socket Layer). It is efficient in cases where the browser needs to fill out forms, sign in, authenticate, and carry out bank transactions.
- ***SSH:** [SSH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-sshsecure-shell-keys) stands for Secure Shell. It is a terminal emulations software similar to Telnet. The reason SSH is preferred is because of its ability to maintain the encrypted connection. It sets up a secure session over a TCP/IP connection.
- **NTP:****[NTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-time-protocol-ntp) stands for Network Time Protocol. It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source. It is very useful in situations like bank transactions. Assume the following situation without the presence of NTP. Suppose you carry out a transaction, where your computer reads the time at 2:30 PM while the server records it at 2:28 PM. The server can crash very badly if it’s out of sync.

The host-to-host layer is a layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that is responsible for providing communication between hosts (computers or other devices) on a network. It is also known as the transport layer.

Some common use cases for the host-to-host layer include:

- ***Reliable Data Transfer:** The host-to-host layer ensures that data is transferred reliably between hosts by using techniques like error correction and flow control. For example, if a packet of data is lost during transmission, the host-to-host layer can request that the packet be retransmitted to ensure that all data is received correctly.
- ***Segmentation and Reassembly:** The host-to-host layer is responsible for breaking up large blocks of data into smaller segments that can be transmitted over the network, and then reassembling the data at the destination. This allows data to be transmitted more efficiently and helps to avoid overloading the network.
- ***Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:*** The host-to-host layer is responsible for multiplexing data from multiple sources onto a single network connection, and then demultiplexing the data at the destination. This allows multiple devices to share the same network connection and helps to improve the utilization of the network.
- **End-to-End Communication:*** The host-to-host layer provides a connection-oriented service that allows hosts to communicate with each other end-to-end, without the need for intermediate devices to be involved in the communication.

## Other Common Internet Protocols

TCP/IP Model covers many Internet Protocols. The main rule of these Internet Protocols is how the data is validated and sent over the Internet. Some Common Internet Protocols include:

- ***HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form) takes care of Web Browsers and Websites. 
- ***FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-in-application-layer) takes care of how the file is to be sent over the Internet.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp) is used to send and receive data.

## What are IP & TCP?

The [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) is the address system of the Internet and has the core function of delivering [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) of information from a source device to a target device. IP is the primary way in which network connections are made, and it establishes the basis of the Internet. IP does not handle packet ordering or error checking. Such functionality requires another protocol, often the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. IP makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. TCP can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent.

IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. That’s where protocols such as TCP come in. TCP is used in conjunction with IP in order to maintain a connection between the sender and the target and to ensure packet order.

For example, when an [email](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email/) is sent over TCP, a connection is established and a 3-way handshake is made. First, the source sends an SYN “initial request” packet to the target server in order to start the dialogue. Then the target server sends a SYN-ACK packet to agree to the process. Lastly, the source sends an ACK packet to the target to confirm the process, after which the message contents can be sent. The email message is ultimately broken down into packets before each packet is sent out into the Internet, where it traverses a series of gateways before arriving at the target device where the group of packets are reassembled by TCP into the original contents of the email.

![TCP handshake diagram](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/cdn/tls-ssl/tcp-handshake-diagram.png "TCP handshake diagram")

The primary version of IP used on the Internet today is Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4). Due to size constraints with the total number of possible addresses in IPv4, a newer protocol was developed. The newer protocol is called IPv6. It makes many more addresses available and is increasing in adoption.
