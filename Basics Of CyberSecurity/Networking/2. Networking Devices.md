Network devices, also known as networking hardware, are physical devices that allow hardware on a computer network to communicate and interact with one another. For example Repeater, Hub, Bridge, Switch, Routers, Gateway, and NIC, etc.

## Types Of Networking Devices

### 1. Repeater
It is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of signal and retransmits it, allowing it to further transmit the signal. It not only amplify the signal but also regenerate it. It is a 2-Port device and it operates at **Physical Layer.**

### 2. Hubs
A network hub is a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it. It is a common connection point for devices in a network. It handles a data type called **Frame.** It only supports half-duplex transmission and it broadcasts data as it is unable to filter the data. It is a dumb device because it has no brain or memory, it has no smarts. It works on **Physical Layer** and it is Passive Device and only star topology is possible. It is also known as concentrators.

#### Types of Hubs:

1.  ***Active Hub:*** These are the hubs that have their power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring centre. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.
2. ***Passive Hub*:*** These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend the distance between nodes.
3. ***Intelligent Hub:** It works like an active hub and includes remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.

### 3. Switch
 A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency (a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. A ***switch is a data link layer device***. The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.  In other words, the switch divides the collision domain of hosts, but the [broadcast domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_domain)
 remains the same. It supports Full-Duplex Mode. It is used to segment the networks into different subnetworks called subnets.

#### Working Of A Switch

When switch receives a frame, it has to choose between three actions to take.

- **Forward:** If mac address entries are present in cam table, It will forward the data frame from one device to another.
- **Drop It:** If source and destination mac are same it will drop it.
- **Flood It:** When destination entry isn't present, it will make a copy of a frame and sent it to all connected nodes.

#### Features of Switch

- Performs error checking before forwarding data packets.
- It supports unicast, multicast and broadcast.
- Packet switching techniques are used. (Dividing a larger data packet into pieces.)
- It depends upon the CAM table.

#### Types of  Switch

1. Unmanaged switches: These switches have a simple plug-and-play design and do not offer advanced configuration options. They are suitable for small networks or for use as an expansion to a larger network.
2. Managed switches: These switches offer advanced configuration options such as VLANs, QoS, and link aggregation. They are suitable for larger, more complex networks and allow for centralized management.
3. Smart switches: These switches have features similar to managed switches but are typically easier to set up and manage. They are suitable for small- to medium-sized networks.
4. Layer 2 switches: These switches operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model and are responsible for forwarding data between devices on the same network segment.
5. Layer 3 switches: These switches operate at the Network layer of the OSI model and can route data between different network segments. They are more advanced than Layer 2 switches and are often used in larger, more complex networks.
6. PoE switches: These switches have Power over Ethernet capabilities, which allows them to supply power to network devices over the same cable that carries data.
7. Gigabit switches: These switches support Gigabit Ethernet speeds, which are faster than traditional Ethernet speeds.
8. Rack-mounted switches: These switches are designed to be mounted in a server rack and are suitable for use in data centres or other large networks.
9. Desktop switches: These switches are designed for use on a desktop or in a small office environment and are typically smaller in size than rack-mounted switches.
10. Modular switches: These switches have modular design, which allows for easy expansion or customization. They are suitable for large networks and data centres.
#### ARP & ARP TABLE

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is the protocol that bridges Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the OSI model**, which in the typical TCP/IP stack is effectively gluing together the Ethernet and Internet Protocol layers. It used **to map MAC addresses to IP addresses**. 

By extension, an ARP table is simply **the method for storing the information discovered through ARP**. It's used to record the discovered MAC and IP address pairs of devices connected to a network.

### CAM Table

**Content Addressable Memory (CAM)** table stores MAC addresses of connected devices available on physical ports with their associated VLAN Parameters. This table also contains port and aging information. Switch uses CAM table to switch ethernet frames, making forwarding decisions and aged out old devices. Switches learn MAC addresses from ARP response packet.

### VLAN

A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical grouping of ports on a switch that are independent of physical location. VLANs can be used to divide a physical network into separate broadcast domains, which can improve security and administration.

> [!NOTE] Important Points to be Noted
> 1. Frame has MAC Addresses.
> 2. Packet has IP Addresses.
> 3. FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is a broadcast address.
> 4. Every VLAN has it's own CAM table.
> 5. Switches - Frame - Layer2
> 6. Routers - Packets - Layer3


### 4. Router

A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. One or more [packet-switched networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switched-network-psn-in-networking/) or subnetworks can be connected using a router. By sending data packets to their intended [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/), it manages traffic between different networks and permits several devices to share an [Internet connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-connection/).

## Types of Router

There are several types of routers. Some of them are mentioned below:

1. **Broadband Routers:*** These are one of the important kinds of routers. It is used to do different types of things. it is used to connect [computers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-computers/) or it is also used to connect to the internet.
2. **Wireless routers:**** These routers are used to create a wireless signal in your office or home.
3. ***Wired Routers:*** Wired Router is used to connects multiple wired devices using a Ethernet cable, It takes the transmission data from the modem and distribute it to a further network, it is widely used in schools and small offices.
4. **Edge Routers**: As the name indicates, these are located at the edges usually connected to an [Internet Service Provider](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isp-full-form/), and distribute packets across multiple packets.
5. ***Core Routers:** Core routers distribute packets within the same network. The main task is to carry heavy data transfers.
6. **Virtual Router:*** They are implemented using a software on the virtual machine , and they are more flexible and scalable.
7. **Portable Routers:** They are used to create private Wi-Fi and hence designed for easy portability.

## Functions of Router

The router performs below major functions: 

1. ***Forwarding:** The router receives the packets from its input ports, checks its header, performs some basic functions like checking [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/), and then looks up to the routing table to find the appropriate output port to dump the packets onto, and forwards the packets onto that output port.
2. ***Routing:*** Routing is the process by which the router ascertains what is the best path for the packet to reach the destination, It maintains a routing table that is made using different [algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/) by the router only.
3. ***Network Address Translation (NAT):** Routers use [NAT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/) to translate between different IP address ranges. This allows devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address.
4. ***Security:** Routers can be configured with [firewalls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/) and other security features to protect the network from unauthorized access, [malware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/malware-and-its-types/), and other threats.
5. ***Quality of Service (QoS):** Routers can prioritize network traffic based on the type of data being transmitted. This ensures that critical applications and services receive adequate bandwidth and are not affected by lower-priority traffic.
6. ***Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity:** Routers can be configured to allow remote users to connect securely to the network using a [VPN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vpn-virtual-private-network/).
7. ***Bandwidth management:** Routers can be used to manage network [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-bandwidth/) by controlling the amount of data that is allowed to flow through the network. This can prevent network congestion and ensure that critical applications and services receive adequate bandwidth.
8. ***Monitoring and diagnostics***: Routers can be configured to monitor network traffic and provide diagnostics information in the event of network failures or other issues. This allows network administrators to quickly identify and resolve problems.

## Routing Protocol

The router can recognise other routers on the network and decide on a dynamic basis where to deliver all network messages through the routing protocol. Several protocols exist, some of which are listed below:

- ***Open Shortest Path First:** As packets travel across several networks, it is utilised to determine the optimal path for them to take in order to arrive at their destination.
- ***Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):*** It facilitates information sharing between edge routers to control internet packet routing. For routers, it offers network stability. It can easily switch to another network connection to transfer the packets.
- ***Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) :*** IGRP outlines the protocol for exchanging routing data between gateways inside the separate networks. The routing information can then be used by the other network protocols to decide how data packets should be routed.
- **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP):**** This protocol requests a router to route its neighbours if it cannot find a path to a destination from the routing tables. The neighbours then forward the request to further neighbours until a router finds the path.
- **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP):**** It is also frequently used for the communication of routing table data between internet hosts.

### 5. Bridge

A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. It has a single input and single output port, thus making it a 2 port device.

#### Types of Bridges
- ***Transparent Bridges:-*** These are the bridge in which the stations are completely unaware of the bridge’s existence i.e. whether or not a bridge is added or deleted from the network, reconfiguration of the stations is unnecessary. These bridges make use of two processes i.e. bridge forwarding and bridge learning.
- ***Source Routing Bridges:-*** In these bridges, routing operation is performed by the source station and the frame specifies which route to follow. The host can discover the frame by sending a special frame called the discovery frame, which spreads through the entire network using all possible paths to the destination.
