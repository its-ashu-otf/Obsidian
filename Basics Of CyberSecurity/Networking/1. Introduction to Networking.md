## What is a Network?
A network is a group of two or more computers that are connected to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. 

Each device on a network is called a **NODE** and each node has it's own Address.

Example:

- Our Home Network

## Internet

The internet, sometimes simply called the net, is **a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks** that allows users to communicate with each other and access information. The full form of Internet is **Interconnected Network**.

### Network Components

1. **Endpoints** (Nodes): _Endpoints_ are physical devices that connect to a network system such as mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
2. **Network Interface Card** (NIC): NIC stands for *Network Interface Card*, and it's a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. NICs are also known as network adapters, network interface controllers, Wi-Fi cards, or LAN adapters.
3. **Switch:** A network switch is a key component of a network that connects devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, so they can communicate with each other. Switches forward data packets to and from devices, rather than sending them to networks like a router does.
4. **Router**:  A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
5. **Servers**:  Server is a computer program or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. 
6. **Access Point / WAP**: An access point (AP), also known as a wireless access point (WAP) or wireless router, is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a bridge between devices and the network, allowing devices to access network resources wirelessly.
7. **Firewalls:** A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls network traffic based on a set of security rules. Firewalls are designed to create a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They can be built into hardware, software, or a combination of both.
8. **Ethernet Cable:** An ethernet cable allows the user to connect their devices such as computers, mobile phones, routers, etc, to a Local Area Network (LAN) that will allow a user to have internet access, and able to communicate with each other through a wired connection.

### Types Of Networks

1.  **LAN**: A Local Area Network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in a one physical location, such as a building, office, or home.![[Pasted image 20240620013330.png]]
2. **PAN**: A Personal Area Network (PAN)connects devices within a user's immediate area. The size of PAN ranges from a few centimetre's to few meters. Ex: Phone Connected to Bluetooth Devices. ![[Pasted image 20240620013916.png]]
3. **CAN**: It is a network used in educational environments.
4. **MAN**: A Metropolitan Area Network connects multiple LAN's across  a large area. A metropolitan area can be single city, multiple cities and towns, or any large area with many buildings.

5. **WAN**: A Wide Area Network is a computer network that covers a large geographical area consisting of two or more LAN's or MAN's. It connects networks over a large area.  ![[Pasted image 20240620014735.jpg]]
6. **SAN**:  A Storage Area Network is a computer network of storage devices that can be accessed by multiple servers or computers, providing a shared pool of storage space.![[Pasted image 20240620015107.jpg]]
7. **POLAN**: Passive Optical Local Area Network is designed to allow a single fibre from a service provider the ability to maintain an efficient broadband. It is a low-cost network that can link various locations to one central network. POLAN's have the power to connect multiple entities to one hub.![[Pasted image 20240620015404.jpg]]
8. **VPN**: VPN stands for virtual private network, and it's a service that encrypts a device's internet connection and hides its IP address to protect the user's privacy. This creates a private connection that can help keep sensitive data safe from unauthorized access, and it can also allow users to conduct work remotely. ![[Pasted image 20240620015505.png]]
9. **SAN**: System Area Network  is a high performance, connection oriented network that can link a cluster of computers.
10. **EPN**: Enterprise Private Network is a computer network built by a business to interconnect it's various company sites such as production sites, offices, shops, etc.
