## What is a Network?
A network is a group of two or more computers that are connected to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. 

Each device on a network is called a **NODE** and each node has it's own Address.

Example:

- Our Home Network

## Internet

The internet, sometimes simply called the net, is **a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks** that allows users to communicate with each other and access information. The full form of Internet is **Interconnected Network**.

## Birth of Internet

The birth of the internet is a fascinating journey that spans several decades and involves contributions from many individuals and organizations. Here is a concise overview of the key milestones and developments:

### Early Foundations (1950s-1960s)

1. **Conceptual Beginnings**:
   - **J.C.R. Licklider**: In 1962, psychologist and computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider of MIT proposed the concept of an "Intergalactic Computer Network," envisioning a globally interconnected set of computers.
   
2. **Packet Switching**:
   - **Paul Baran**: In the early 1960s, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation developed the concept of packet switching, which would become a fundamental technology for the internet. Packet switching involves breaking data into smaller packets that are sent independently across a network and reassembled at the destination.
   - **Donald Davies**: Simultaneously, Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK independently developed similar packet switching concepts.

### ARPANET (1960s-1970s)

1. **ARPANET Creation**:
   - **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)**: In 1969, ARPA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, funded the creation of ARPANET, the first operational packet-switching network. The first node was installed at UCLA, followed by nodes at Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.
   - **First Message**: On October 29, 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford. The intended message was "LOGIN," but only "LO" was transmitted before the system crashed.

2. **Expansion and Protocols**:
   - **Network Control Protocol (NCP)**: ARPANET initially used NCP, which allowed different computers to communicate.
   - **Email**: In 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email on ARPANET, using the "@" symbol to designate email addresses.

### Development of TCP/IP (1970s-1980s)

1. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**:
   - **Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn**: In the 1970s, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which allowed disparate networks to interconnect and communicate, forming the basis of the modern internet.
   - **Adoption**: By January 1, 1983, ARPANET fully switched to using TCP/IP, marking the beginning of the modern internet.

### Emergence of the Modern Internet (1980s-1990s)

1. **Domain Name System (DNS)**:
   - **DNS Implementation**: In 1984, the Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced, allowing users to use human-readable names (like www.example.com) instead of numeric IP addresses.

2. **Commercialization and Expansion**:
   - **NSFNET**: The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was established in 1985, connecting supercomputer centers across the U.S. and eventually replacing ARPANET as the backbone of the internet.
   - **Commercial Use**: By the late 1980s and early 1990s, commercial entities began to use the internet, leading to its rapid expansion.

### The World Wide Web (1990s)

1. **Creation of the Web**:
   - **Tim Berners-Lee**: In 1989-1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, invented the World Wide Web. He developed HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the first web browser, transforming the internet into a more user-friendly and accessible platform.

2. **Public Access and Growth**:
   - **Mosaic Browser**: In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was released, making the web more accessible to the general public and spurring the growth of websites and online services.
   - **Commercialization**: The mid-1990s saw a surge in commercial use of the internet, with the launch of major web services, e-commerce platforms, and the dot-com boom.

### Summary

The internet's birth and evolution were driven by groundbreaking research, innovative technologies, and collaborative efforts across various fields. From early concepts of interconnected networks to the development of protocols and the creation of the World Wide Web, the internet has transformed into a global communication platform that underpins much of modern life.
### Network Components

1. **Endpoints** (Nodes): _Endpoints_ are physical devices that connect to a network system such as mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
2. **Network Interface Card** (NIC): NIC stands for *Network Interface Card*, and it's a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. NICs are also known as network adapters, network interface controllers, Wi-Fi cards, or LAN adapters.
3. **Switch:** A network switch is a key component of a network that connects devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, so they can communicate with each other. Switches forward data packets to and from devices, rather than sending them to networks like a router does.
4. **Router**:  A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
5. **Servers**:  Server is a computer program or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. 
6. **Access Point / WAP**: An access point (AP), also known as a wireless access point (WAP) or wireless router, is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a bridge between devices and the network, allowing devices to access network resources wirelessly.
7. **Firewalls:** A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls network traffic based on a set of security rules. Firewalls are designed to create a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They can be built into hardware, software, or a combination of both.
8. **Ethernet Cable:** An ethernet cable allows the user to connect their devices such as computers, mobile phones, routers, etc, to a Local Area Network (LAN) that will allow a user to have internet access, and able to communicate with each other through a wired connection.

### Types Of Networks

1.  **LAN**: A Local Area Network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in a one physical location, such as a building, office, or home.![[Pasted image 20240620013330.png]]
2. **PAN**: A Personal Area Network (PAN)connects devices within a user's immediate area. The size of PAN ranges from a few centimetre's to few meters. Ex: Phone Connected to Bluetooth Devices. ![[Pasted image 20240620013916.png]]
3. **CAN**: It is a network used in educational environments.
4. **MAN**: A Metropolitan Area Network connects multiple LAN's across  a large area. A metropolitan area can be single city, multiple cities and towns, or any large area with many buildings.
    ![[Pasted image 20240620014356.png]]
5. **WAN**: A Wide Area Network is a computer network that covers a large geographical area consisting of two or more LAN's or MAN's. It connects networks over a large area.  ![[Pasted image 20240620014735.jpg]]
6. **SAN**:  A Storage Area Network is a computer network of storage devices that can be accessed by multiple servers or computers, providing a shared pool of storage space.![[Pasted image 20240620015107.jpg]]
7. **POLAN**: Passive Optical Local Area Network is designed to allow a single fibre from a service provider the ability to maintain an efficient broadband. It is a low-cost network that can link various locations to one central network. POLAN's have the power to connect multiple entities to one hub.![[Pasted image 20240620015404.jpg]]
8. **VPN**: VPN stands for virtual private network, and it's a service that encrypts a device's internet connection and hides its IP address to protect the user's privacy. This creates a private connection that can help keep sensitive data safe from unauthorized access, and it can also allow users to conduct work remotely. ![[Pasted image 20240620015505.png]]
9. **SAN**: System Area Network  is a high performance, connection oriented network that can link a cluster of computers.
10. **EPN**: Enterprise Private Network is a computer network built by a business to interconnect it's various company sites such as production sites, offices, shops, etc.
