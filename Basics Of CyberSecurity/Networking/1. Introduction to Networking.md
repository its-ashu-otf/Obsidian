## What is a Network?
A network is a group of two or more computers that are connected to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. 

Each device on a network is called a **NODE** and each node has it's own Address.

Example:

- Our Home Network

## Internet

The internet, sometimes simply called the net, is **a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks** that allows users to communicate with each other and access information. The full form of Internet is **Interconnected Network**.

### Network Components

1. **Endpoints** (Nodes): _Endpoints_ are physical devices that connect to a network system such as mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
2. **Network Interface Card** (NIC): NIC stands for *Network Interface Card*, and it's a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. NICs are also known as network adapters, network interface controllers, Wi-Fi cards, or LAN adapters.
3. **Switch:** A network switch is a key component of a network that connects devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, so they can communicate with each other. Switches forward data packets to and from devices, rather than sending them to networks like a router does.
4. **Router**:  A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
5. **Servers**:  Server is a computer program or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. 
6. **Access Point / WAP**: An access point (AP), also known as a wireless access point (WAP) or wireless router, is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a bridge between devices and the network, allowing devices to access network resources wirelessly.
7. **Firewalls:** A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls network traffic based on a set of security rules. Firewalls are designed to create a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They can be built into hardware, software, or a combination of both.
8. **Ethernet Cable:** An ethernet cable allows the user to connect their devices such as computers, mobile phones, routers, etc, to a Local Area Network (LAN) that will allow a user to have internet access, and able to communicate with each other through a wired connection.
