## What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?

Transmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network. The Internet Protocol (IP), which establishes the technique for sending data packets between computers, works with TCP.

The position of TCP is at the transport layer of the OSI model. TCP also helps in ensuring that information is transmitted accurately by establishing a virtual connection between the sender and receiver.

## What is Internet Protocol (IP)?

Internet Protocol is a method that is useful for sending data from one device to another from all over the internet. Every device contains a unique IP Address that helps it communicate and exchange data across other devices present on the internet.

For more, you can refer to the [TCP/IP Model.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/)

## Working of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

To make sure that each message reaches its target location intact, the TCP/IP model breaks down the data into small bundles and afterward reassembles the bundles into the original message on the opposite end. Sending the information in little bundles of information makes it simpler to maintain efficiency as opposed to sending everything in one go. 

After a particular message is broken down into bundles, these bundles may travel along multiple routes if one route is jammed but the destination remains the same.

TCP

**For Example:** When a user requests a web page on the internet, somewhere in the world, the server processes that request and sends back an HTML Page to that user. The server makes use of a protocol called the HTTP Protocol. The HTTP then requests the TCP layer to set the required connection and send the HTML file.

Now, the TCP breaks the data into small packets and forwards it toward the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. The packets are then sent to the destination through different routes.

The TCP layer in the user’s system waits for the transmission to get finished and acknowledges once all packets have been received.

## Features of TCP/IP

Some of the most prominent features of Transmission control protocol are mentioned below.

- **Segment Numbering System:** TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to each and every single one of them. A specific Byte Number is assigned to data bytes that are to be transferred while segments are assigned __sequence numbers__. Acknowledgment Numbers are assigned to received segments.
- **Connection Oriented:** It means sender and receiver are connected to each other till the completion of the process. The order of the data is maintained i.e. order remains same before and after transmission.
- **Full Duplex:** In TCP data can be transmitted from receiver to the sender or vice – versa at the same time. It increases efficiency of data flow between sender and receiver. 
- **Flow Control:** Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery. The receiver continually hints to the sender on how much data can be received (using a sliding window).
- **Error Control:** TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer. Error control is byte-oriented. Segments are checked for error detection. Error Control includes – Corrupted Segment & Lost Segment Management, Out-of-order segments, Duplicate segments, etc.
- **Congestion Control:** TCP takes into account the level of congestion in the network. Congestion level is determined by the amount of data sent by a sender.

## Advantages of TCP

- It is a reliable protocol.
- It provides an error-checking mechanism as well as one for recovery.
- It gives flow control.
- It makes sure that the data reaches the proper destination in the exact order that it was sent.
- Open Protocol, not owned by any organization or individual.
- It assigns an IP address to each computer on the network and a domain name to each site thus making each device site to be distinguishable over the network.

## Disadvantages of TCP
- TCP is made for Wide Area Networks, thus its size can become an issue for small networks with low resources.
- TCP runs several layers so it can slow down the speed of the network.
- It is not generic in nature. Meaning, it cannot represent any protocol stack other than the TCP/IP suite. E.g., it cannot work with a Bluetooth connection.
- No modifications since their development around 30 years ago.

# TCP flags

In TCP connection, flags are used to indicate a particular state of connection or to provide some additional useful information like troubleshooting purposes or to handle a control of a particular connection. Most commonly used flags are **“SYN”, “ACK” and “FIN”**. Each flag corresponds to 1 bit information. 

**Types of Flags:**   
 

- **Synchronization (SYN) –** It is used in first step of [connection establishment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-connection-establishment/) phase or 3-way handshake process between the two hosts. Only the first packet from sender as well as receiver should have this flag set. This is used for synchronizing sequence number i.e. to tell the other end which sequence number they should accept.
- **Acknowledgement (ACK) –** It is used to acknowledge packets which are successful received by the host. The flag is set if the acknowledgement number field contains a valid acknowledgement number.   
    In given below diagram, the receiver sends an ACK = 1 as well as SYN = 1 in the second step of connection establishment to tell sender that it received its initial packet.   
     
- **Finish (FIN) –** It is used to request for [connection termination](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-connection-termination/) i.e. when there is no more data from the sender, it requests for connection termination. This is the last packet sent by sender. It frees the reserved resources and gracefully terminate the connection.   
     
- **Reset (RST) –** It is used to terminate the connection if the RST sender feels something is wrong with the TCP connection or that the conversation should not exist. It can get send from receiver side when packet is send to particular host that was not expecting it. 
- **Urgent (URG) –** It is used to indicate that the data contained in the packet should be prioritized and handled urgently by the receiver. This flag is used in combination with the Urgent Pointer field to identify the location of the urgent data in the packet.
- **Push (PSH) –** It is used to request immediate data delivery to the receiving host, without waiting for additional data to be buffered on the sender’s side. This flag is commonly used in applications such as real-time audio or video streaming.
- **Window (WND) –** It is used to communicate the size of the receive window to the sender. The window size is the amount of data that the receiving host is capable of accepting at any given time. The sender should limit the amount of data it sends based on the size of the window advertised by the receiver.
- **Checksum (CHK) –** It is used to verify the integrity of the TCP segment during transmission. The checksum is computed over the entire segment, including the header and data fields, and is recalculated at each hop along the network path.
- **Sequence Number (SEQ) –** It is a unique number assigned to each segment by the sender to identify the order in which packets should be received by the receiver. The sequence number is used in conjunction with the acknowledgement number to ensure reliable data transfer and to prevent duplicate packets.
- **Acknowledgement Number (ACK) –** It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment and to communicate the next expected sequence number to the sender. The acknowledgement number field contains the sequence number of the next expected segment, rather than the number of the last received segment.

**Finish (FIN) v/s Reset (RST) –**

- **Push (PSH) –** Transport layer by default waits for some time for application layer to send enough data equal to maximum segment size so that the number of packets transmitted on network minimizes which is not desirable by some application like interactive applications(chatting). Similarly transport layer at receiver end buffers packets and transmit to application layer if it meets certain criteria. 
    
    This problem is solved by using PSH. Transport layer sets PSH = 1 and immediately sends the segment to network layer as soon as it receives signal from application layer. Receiver transport layer, on seeing PSH = 1 immediately forwards the data to application layer.   
    In general, it tells the receiver to process these packets as they are received instead of buffering them.   
     
    
- **Urgent (URG) -** Data inside a segment with URG = 1 flag is forwarded to application layer immediately even if there are more data to be given to application layer. It is used to notify the receiver to process the urgent packets before processing all other packets. The receiver will be notified when all known urgent data has been received.

**Push (PSH) v/s Urgent (URG) –**
