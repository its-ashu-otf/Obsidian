# Troubleshooting Questions on OS and Networking asked in Cloud based Interview

- Firstly, what is troubleshooting?

Troubleshooting is basically an art, the art of taking a problem into consideration gathering pieces of information about the problem, and understanding it. Finally, analyzing it using the information and most importantly solving it.

Now, let’s start with some questions…

1. Troubleshoot System running Slow. The first step to this problem is understanding the reason behind this problem. Possible reasons for this problem could be
    
    1. Processor related issue
    2. Disk related issue
    3. Networking related issue
    4. Hardware related issue.
    
    - **Checking processor:** Checking the memory stat and virtual memory stat gives an idea about which process is taking how much memory.
        
        **Commands can be used:** 
        
        1. `top  2. free  3. lscpu`
        
    - **Checking Disk:** Sometimes the disk is full which leads to a system slow and delay in the processing of other processes. Checking disk stat will give the idea about what’s coming in and what’s going out.
        
        **Commands can be used:** 
        
        1. `df-u  2. du  3. iostat  4. lsof`
        
    - **Checking Network:** Checking the network will you an idea about which port is listening to what and display the packets that are been transmitted and received.
        
        Commands can be used: 
        
        1. `tcpdump  2. iftop  3. netstat  4. traceroute`
        
    - **Checking Hardware and other things:** Checking the hardware for any kind of physical damage and also checking system uptime will give you an idea about how long the system hasn’t shut down which.
        
        Commands can be used: 
        
        1. `iscpu  2. isblk  3. ispci  4. uptime`
        
2. Troubleshoot Wi-Fi connectivity is slow.
    
    1. Check the speed of the internet. Before jumping to any conclusion, check the speed of the internet and match it with your internet pack.
    2. Reboot your Modem and Router. Sometimes, the router gets stuck in a bad state. The problem can be fixed with a reboot.
    3. Improve your Wi-Fi Position. It is highly recommended to place your router at a higher place because in some instances thicker walls or some metals may obstruct the signal.
    4. Using QoS to fix slow internet. Dividing available bandwidth on your Wi-Fi network between applications.
    5. Try changing DNS (Domain Name Server). DNS servers are provided by your ISP. But if they are slow and overloaded, switch DNS (Available DNS options: Google Public DNS & Open DNS)
3. Troubleshoot Device is overheating. There can be two-dimension to this problem. External factors and internal factors.
    
    - **External Factors:**
        
        - Check and clean the fans.
        - Elevate the device for proper ventilation.
        - Keep the device away from heat.
    - **Internal Factors:**
        
        - Avoid using an intense process. Prioritize your process.  
            
            **Command can be used:** 
            
            1. `nice`
            
        - Check for any kind of hardware-related issues. 
            
            **Commands can be used:** 
            
            1. `iscpu  2. isblk  3. ispci  4. uptime)`
            
4. Troubleshoot Running out of memory
    
    - Identify the process causing the memory usage. 
        
        **Command can be used:** 
        
        1. `top`
        
    - Kill or restart the process causing high memory utilization. 
        
        **Command can be used:** 
        
        1. `kill   2.systemctl`
        
    - C. Prioritize the process. 
        
        **Command can be used:** 
        
        1. `nice  2. renice`

    - Add memory physically and virtually.
        
    - Troubleshoot Unable to connect to the internet
        
    - Look for any physical connection cable-related issues.
        
    - Check for Router light/ Restart your router.
        
    - Check whether you are using the correct SSID (router name)
        
    - Run Windows network troubleshooting if using Windows.
        
    - Reset TCP/IP
        
        **Command can be used:**

    - Flush DNS
        
        **Command can be used:** 
        
        `ipconfig/flushdns`
        
    - Release/ Reset IP.
        
        **Command can be used:** 
        
        `ipconfig/release ipconfig/renew`
        
    - Reinstall network drivers.

## What is a Ping?
A ping is a basic Internet command that allows a user to test and verify whether a given destination IP address exists and can accept requests in computer network administration. Ping is also used for diagnosis to confirm that the computer the user tries to reach is operational. Ping can be used with any operating system (OS) that supports networking. Ping (Packet Internet Groper) is a method for determining communication latency between two networks or ping is a method of determining the time it takes for data to travel between two devices or across a network. As communication latency decreases, communication effectiveness improves. A low ping time is critical in situations where the timely delivery of data is more important than the quantity and quality of the desired information.

## How Does Ping Work?

Ping sends an [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/) Echo Request to a network interface and then waits for a response. When the ping command is executed, a ping signal is delivered to the provided address. When the target host receives the echo request, it answers with an echo reply packet. This method has two distinct purposes: calculating [round-trip time (RTT)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-rttround-trip-time/) or latency and ensuring that the target host is available. RTT is a measure of the time it takes to receive a response. Measured in milliseconds (ms), the process begins when a browser submits a request to a server and concludes when the server responds. RTT is an important performance figure for online applications.

## Introduction to Traceroute:****

The traceroute command is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the route taken by packets from a source to a destination over an IP network. It provides valuable insights into the network path, including the number of hops (routers) between the source and destination, and the round-trip time (RTT) for each hop.

## Basic Syntax of Traceroute:****

The basic syntax of the traceroute command is as follows:

traceroute [options] destination

***Options:** Various options can be used to customize the behaviour of the traceroute command, allowing users to specify parameters such as the maximum number of hops, the number of probes per hop, and the timeout for each probe.

## Understanding Traceroute Output:****

When executed, the `traceroute` command provides a detailed output that reveals the path taken by packets to reach the destination. Each line in the output represents a hop along the route, displaying the IP address of the router, its hostname (if available), and the round-trip time (RTT) for the probe.

## Options Available in Traceroute

| Option       | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| -4           | Use IPv4                                    |
| -6           | Use IPv6                                    |
| -F           | Do not fragment packet                      |
| -f first_ttl | Start from the first TTL hop                |
| -g gate      | Route the packet through gate               |
| -m max_ttl   | Set the max number of hops                  |
| -n           | Do not resolve IP addresses to domain names |
| -p port      | Set the destination port                    |
| -q nqueries  | Set the number of probes per each hop       |
| packetlen    | The full packet length                      |
| –help        | Display help messages and exit              |

## What is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)?

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a [network layer](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/) protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues. ICMP is mainly used to determine whether or not data is reaching its intended destination in a timely manner. Commonly, the ICMP [protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/) is used on network devices, such as [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/). ICMP is crucial for error reporting and testing, but it can also be used in [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

## What is ICMP used for?

The primary purpose of ICMP is for error reporting. When two devices connect over the Internet, the ICMP generates errors to share with the sending device in the event that any of the data did not get to its intended destination. For example, if a [packet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) of data is too large for a router, the router will drop the packet and send an ICMP message back to the original source for the data.

A secondary use of ICMP protocol is to perform network diagnostics; the commonly used terminal utilities traceroute and ping both operate using ICMP.

## What is an ICMP packet?

An ICMP packet is a packet that uses the ICMP protocol. ICMP packets include an ICMP header after a normal IP header. When a router or server needs to send an error message, the ICMP packet body or data section always contains a copy of the IP header of the packet that caused the error.
