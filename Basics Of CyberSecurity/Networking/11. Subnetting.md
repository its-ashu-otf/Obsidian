## What is a subnet?

A subnet, or subnetwork, is a [network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/) inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) to reach its destination.

Imagine Alice puts a letter in the mail that is addressed to Bob, who lives in the town right next to hers. For the letter to reach Bob as quickly as possible, it should be delivered right from Alice's post office to the post office in Bob's town, and then to Bob. If the letter is first sent to a post office hundreds of miles away, Alice's letter could take a lot longer to reach Bob.

Like the postal service, networks are more efficient when messages travel as directly as possible. When a network receives data packets from another network, it will sort and route those packets by subnet so that the packets do not take an inefficient route to their destination.

## Why is subnetting necessary?

As the previous example illustrates, the way IP addresses are constructed makes it relatively simple for Internet routers to find the right network to route data into. However, in a Class A network (for instance), there could be millions of connected devices, and it could take some time for the data to find the right device. This is why subnetting comes in handy: subnetting narrows down the IP address to usage within a range of devices.

Because an IP address is limited to indicating the network and the device address, IP addresses cannot be used to indicate which subnet an IP packet should go to. Routers within a network use something called a subnet mask to sort data into subnetworks.

## What is a subnet mask?

A subnet mask is like an IP address, but for only internal usage within a network. Routers use subnet masks to route data packets to the right place. Subnet masks are not indicated within data packets traversing the Internet — those packets only indicate the destination IP address, which a router will match with a subnet.

Suppose Bob answers Alice's letter, but he sends his reply to Alice's place of employment rather than her home. Alice's office is quite large with many different departments. To ensure employees receive their correspondence quickly, the administrative team at Alice's workplace sorts mail by department rather than by individual employee. After receiving Bob's letter, they look up Alice's department and see she works in Customer Support. They send the letter to the Customer Support department instead of to Alice, and the customer support department gives it to Alice.

In this analogy, "Alice" is like an IP address and "Customer Support" is like a subnet mask. By matching Alice to her department, Bob's letter was quickly sorted into the right group of potential recipients. Without this step, office administrators would have to spend time laboriously looking for the exact location of Alice's desk, which could be anywhere in the building.

For a real-world example, suppose an IP packet is addressed to the IP address 192.0.2.15. This IP address is a Class C network, so the network is identified by "192.0.2" (or to be technically precise, 192.0.2.0/24). Network routers forward the packet to a host on the network indicated by "192.0.2."

Once the packet arrives at that network, a router within the network consults its routing table. It does some binary mathematics using its subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, sees the device address "15" (the rest of the IP address indicates the network), and calculates which subnet the packet should go to. It forwards the packet to the router or [switch](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/) responsible for delivering packets within that subnet, and the packet arrives at IP address 192.0.2.15 (learn more about [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) and [switches](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/)).

## A quick subnetting hack !!

![[Pasted image 20240623185246.png]]

If there is 255 in the octet that means that corresponding octet will be same, it will not change

							192.168.1.204
							   |   |  |  
							255.255.255.0

- Here, 1 octet holds a value of 8 bit making it total of 32 Bits.

![[Pasted image 20240623185706.png]]

192.168.1.0 is Network Address. (This is untouchable)
192.168.1.1 is Default Gateway AKA Router.
192.168.1.255 is Broadcast Address.

## How Does Subnetting Work?

The working of subnets starts in such a way that firstly it divides the subnets into smaller subnets. For communicating between subnets, routers are used. Each subnet allows its linked devices to communicate with each other. Subnetting for a network should be done in such a way that it does not affect the network bits.

In [class C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing) the first 3 octets are network bits so it remains as it is. 

- ***For Subnet-1:** The first bit which is chosen from the host id part is zero and the range will be from (193.1.2.00000000 till you get all 1’s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.01111111) except for the first bit which is chosen zero for subnet id part.

Thus, the range of subnet 1 is: ***193.1.2.0 to 193.1.2.127** 

Subnet id of Subnet-1 is : 193.1.2.0  
The direct Broadcast id of Subnet-1 is: 193.1.2.127  
The total number of hosts possible is: 126 (Out of 128,   
2 id's are used for Subnet id & Direct Broadcast id)  
The subnet mask of Subnet- 1 is: 255.255.255.128

- ***For Subnet-2:** The first bit chosen from the host id part is one and the range will be from (193.1.2.100000000 till you get all 1’s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.11111111).

Thus, the range of subnet-2 is: ***193.1.2.128 to 193.1.2.255** 

Subnet id of Subnet-2 is : 193.1.2.128  
The direct Broadcast id of Subnet-2 is: 193.1.2.255  
The total number of hosts possible is: 126 (Out of 128,   
2 id's are used for Subnet id &  Direct Broadcast id)  
The subnet mask of Subnet- 2 is: 255.255.255.128  
The best way to find out the subnet mask of a subnet  
is to set the fixed bit of host-id to 1 and the rest to 0.

Finally, after using the subnetting the total number of usable hosts is reduced from 254 to 252. 

**Note:***

1. To divide a network into four (22) parts you need to choose two bits from the host id part for each subnet i.e, (00, 01, 10, 11).
2. To divide a network into eight (23) parts you need to choose three bits from the host id part for each subnet i.e, (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) and so on.
3. We can say that if the total number of subnets in a network increases the total number of usable hosts decreases.

Along with the advantage, there is a small disadvantage to subnetting that is, before subnetting to find the IP address first the network id is found then the host id followed by the process id, but after subnetting first network id is found then the subnet id then host id and finally process id by this the computation increases.

***Example 1:** An organization is assigned a [class C network address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing) of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192 to divide this into sub-networks. Which of the following is/are valid host IP addresses?

1. 201.35.2.129
2. 201.35.2.191
3. 201.35.2.255
4. Both (A) and (C)

***Solution:**

Converting the last octet of the   
netmask into the binary form: 255.255.255.****11****000000  
Converting the last octet of option 1  
 into the binary form: 201.35.2.****10****000001  
Converting the last octet of option 2   
into the binary form: 201.35.2.****10****111111  
Converting the last octet of option 3   
into the binary form: 201.35.2.****11****111111

From the above, we see that Options 2 and 3 are not valid host IP addresses (as they are broadcast addresses of a subnetwork), and ***OPTION 1** is not a broadcast address and it can be assigned to a host IP.

***Example 2:***  An organization has a class C network address of 201.32.64.0. It uses a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248. Which of the following is NOT a valid broadcast address for any subnetworks?

1. 201.32.64.135
2. 201.32.64.240
3. 201.32.64.207
4. 201.32.64.231

***Solution:**

Converting the last octet of the netmask  
 into the binary form: 255.255.255.***11111****000  
Converting the last octet of option 1   
into the binary form: 201.32.64.****10000****111  
Converting the last octet of option 2   
into the binary form: 201.32.64.****11110****000  
Converting the last octet of option 3   
into the binary form: 201.32.64.****11001****111  
Converting the last octet of option 4   
into the binary form: 201.32.64.****11100****111

From the above, we can see that in OPTION 1, 3, and 4, all the host bits are 1 and give the valid broadcast address of subnetworks.

and ***OPTION 2,** the last three bits of the Host address are not 1 therefore it’s not a valid broadcast address.

## Advantages of Subnetting

The advantages of Subnetting are mentioned below:

1. It provides security to one network from another network. eg) In an Organisation, the code of the Developer department must not be accessed by another department.
2. It may be possible that a particular subnet might need higher network priority than others. For example, a Sales department needs to host webcasts or video conferences.
3. In the case of Small networks, maintenance is easy.

## Disadvantages of Subnetting

The disadvantages of Subnetting are mentioned below:

1. In the case of a single network, only three steps are required to reach a Process i.e Source Host to Destination Network, Destination Network to Destination Host, and then Destination Host to Process.
2. In the case of a Single Network only two IP addresses are wasted to represent Network Id and Broadcast address but in the case of Subnetting two IP addresses are wasted for each Subnet.
3. The cost of the overall Network also increases. Subnetting requires internal routers, Switches, Hubs, Bridges, etc. which are very costly.
