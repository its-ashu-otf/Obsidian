## What is a packet?

All data sent over the Internet is broken down into smaller chunks called "packets." When Bob sends Alice a message, for instance, his message is broken down into smaller pieces and then reassembled on Alice's computer. A packet has two parts: the header, which contains information about the packet itself, and the body, which is the actual data being sent.

At the network layer, networking software attaches a header to each packet when the packet is sent out over the Internet, and on the other end, networking software can use the header to understand how to handle the packet.

A header contains information about the content, source, and destination of each packet (somewhat like stamping an envelope with a destination and return address). For example, an IP header contains the destination [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) of each packet, the total size of the packet, an indication of whether or not the packet has been fragmented (broken up into still smaller pieces) in transit, and a count of how many networks the packet has traveled through.


## What is a port?

A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service. Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.

## What is a port number?

Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain [protocols](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/) — for example, all [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) messages go to port 80. While [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices.

## How do ports make network connections more efficient?

Vastly different types of data flow to and from a computer over the same network connection. The use of ports helps computers understand what to do with the data they receive.

Suppose Bob transfers an MP3 audio recording to Alice using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If Alice's computer passed the MP3 file data to Alice's email application, the email application would not know how to interpret it. But because Bob's file transfer uses the port designated for FTP (port 21), Alice's computer is able to receive and store the file.

Meanwhile, Alice's computer can simultaneously load HTTP webpages using port 80, even though both the webpage files and the MP3 sound file flow to Alice's computer over the same Wi-Fi connection.

## What are the different port numbers?

There are 65,535 possible port numbers, although not all are in common use. Some of the most commonly used ports, along with their associated networking protocol, are:

- **Ports 20 and 21:** File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP is for transferring files between a client and a server.
- **Port 22:** Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is one of many [tunneling](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-tunneling/) protocols that create secure network connections.
- [Port 25](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/smtp-port-25-587/): Historically, [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/). SMTP is used for [email](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email/).
- **Port 53:** [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). DNS is an essential process for the modern Internet; it matches human-readable [domain names](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/) to machine-readable IP addresses, enabling users to load websites and applications without memorizing a long list of IP addresses.
- **Port 80:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the protocol that makes the World Wide Web possible.
- **Port 123:** [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-time/). NTP allows computer clocks to sync with each other, a process that is essential for [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/).
- **Port 179:** [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/). BGP is essential for establishing efficient routes between the large networks that make up the Internet (these large networks are called [autonomous systems](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/)). Autonomous systems use BGP to broadcast which IP addresses they control.
- **Port 443:** [HTTP Secure (HTTPS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/). HTTPS is the secure and encrypted version of HTTP. All HTTPS web traffic goes to port 443. Network services that use HTTPS for encryption, such as [DNS over HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/), also connect at this port.
- **Port 500:** Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), which is part of the process of setting up secure [IPsec](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/) connections.
- **Port 587:** Modern, secure SMTP that uses encryption.
- **Port 3389:** [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-the-remote-desktop-protocol/) (RDP). RDP enables users to remotely connect to their desktop computers from another device.

## Are ports part of the network layer?

Ports are a transport layer (layer 4) concept. Only a transport protocol such as the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) or [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) can indicate which port a packet should go to. TCP and UDP headers have a section for indicating port numbers. [Network layer](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/) protocols — for instance, the [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) — are unaware of what port is in use in a given network connection. In a standard IP header, there is no place to indicate which port the data [packet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) should go to. IP headers only indicate the destination IP address, not the port number at that IP address.

## What is a network protocol?

In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.

Standardized protocols are like a common language that computers can use, similar to how two people from different parts of the world may not understand each other's native languages, but they can communicate using a shared third language. If one computer uses the [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) and a second computer does as well, they will be able to communicate — just as the United Nations relies on its 6 official languages to communicate amongst representatives from all over the globe. But if one computer uses IP and the other does not know this protocol, they will be unable to communicate.

On the Internet, there are different protocols for different types of processes. Protocols are often discussed in terms of which OSI model layer they belong to.

## Which protocols run on the network layer?

As described above, IP is a network layer protocol responsible for routing. But it is not the only network layer protocol.

[**IPsec:**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/) Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) sets up encrypted, authenticated IP connections over a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-vpn/). Technically IPsec is not a protocol, but rather a collection of protocols that includes the Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP), Authentication Header (AH), and Security Associations (SA).

[**ICMP:**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/) The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) reports errors and provides status updates. For example, if a router is unable to deliver a packet, it will send an ICMP message back to the packet's source.

**IGMP:** The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) sets up one-to-many network connections. IGMP helps set up multicasting, meaning multiple computers can receive data packets directed at one [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/).

## What other protocols are used on the Internet?

Some of the most important protocols to know are:

**TCP:** As described above, TCP is a transport layer protocol that ensures reliable data delivery. TCP is meant to be used with IP, and the two protocols are often referenced together as TCP/IP.

**HTTP:** The [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, the Internet that most users interact with. It is used for transferring data between devices. HTTP belongs to the [application layer (layer 7)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-layer-7/), because it puts data into a format that applications (e.g. a browser) can use directly, without further interpretation. The lower layers of the OSI model are handled by a computer's operating system, not applications.

**HTTPS:** The problem with HTTP is that it is not [encrypted](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/) — any attacker who intercepts an HTTP message can read it. [HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/) (HTTP Secure) corrects this by encrypting HTTP messages.

**TLS/SSL:** [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) is the protocol HTTPS uses for encryption. TLS used to be called [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/).

**UDP:** The [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is a faster but less reliable alternative to TCP at the transport layer. It is often used in services like [video streaming](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) and gaming, where fast data delivery is paramount.

## What protocols do routers use?

Network routers use certain protocols to discover the most efficient network paths to other routers. These protocols are not used for transferring user data. Important network routing protocols include:

**BGP:** The [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/) is an application layer protocol networks use to broadcast which IP addresses they control. This information allows routers to decide which networks data packets should pass through on the way to their destinations.

**EIGRP:** The Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) identifies distances between routers. EIGRP automatically updates each router's record of the best routes (called a routing table) and broadcasts those updates to other routers within the network.

**OSPF:** The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol calculates the most efficient network routes based on a variety of factors, including distance and bandwidth.

**RIP:** The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an older routing protocol that identifies distances between routers. RIP is an application layer protocol.

## What is a DHCP?

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. DHCP allows devices to request and be assigned an IP address automatically, as well as other network configurations such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers. This automation simplifies network administration, especially in large networks.

Here’s a more detailed explanation of how DHCP works and its key components:

### How DHCP Works

1. **DHCP Discover**: When a device (referred to as a DHCP client) connects to a network, it sends out a broadcast message called a DHCP Discover. This message is intended to find any available DHCP servers on the network.

2. **DHCP Offer**: When a DHCP server receives a DHCP Discover message, it responds with a DHCP Offer message. This message contains an available IP address and other network configuration information.

3. **DHCP Request**: The client receives the offer(s) from the DHCP server(s) and responds with a DHCP Request message, indicating that it intends to accept the offer and use the provided IP address.

4. **DHCP Acknowledge**: Finally, the DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledge message to the client. This message confirms that the IP address has been allocated to the client for a specific lease duration.

### Key Components

- **DHCP Client**: The device that needs an IP address and other network configuration parameters.
- **DHCP Server**: The server that manages a pool of IP addresses and assigns them to clients. It also provides other network configuration settings.
- **IP Lease**: The duration for which the IP address is assigned to a client. After the lease expires, the client must renew the lease or obtain a new IP address.
- **IP Address Pool**: A range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can allocate to clients.

### Benefits of DHCP

- **Simplified Management**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and network settings, reducing the administrative burden of manual configuration.
- **Reduced Errors**: Minimizes the risk of IP address conflicts and configuration errors that can occur with manual IP address assignment.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Efficiently manages the allocation of IP addresses, ensuring optimal use of available addresses.

### Additional Features

- **DHCP Reservation**: Allows administrators to reserve specific IP addresses for certain devices based on their MAC addresses.
- **DHCP Relay**: Enables DHCP clients and servers to communicate across different subnets.

Overall, DHCP is a critical protocol in IP networks that greatly simplifies the management of network configurations and improves the scalability and reliability of network operations.
