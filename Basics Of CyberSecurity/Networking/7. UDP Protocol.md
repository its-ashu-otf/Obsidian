## What is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP/IP)?

The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as [video playback](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-streaming/) or [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. This allows data to be transferred very quickly, but it can also cause [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) to become lost in transit — and create opportunities for exploitation in the form of [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

## How does UDP work?

Like all [networking protocols](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/), UDP is a standardized method for transferring data between two computers in a network. Compared to other protocols, UDP accomplishes this process in a simple fashion: it sends packets (units of data transmission) directly to a target computer, without establishing a connection first, indicating the order of said packets, or checking whether they arrived as intended. (UDP packets are referred to as ‘datagrams’.)

#### TCP vs. UDP

UDP is faster but less reliable than [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/), another common transport protocol. In a TCP communication, the two computers begin by establishing a connection via an automated process called a ‘handshake.’ Only once this handshake has been completed will one computer actually transfer data packets to the other.

UDP communications do not go through this process. Instead, one computer can simply begin sending data to the other:

![TCP vs UDP Communication](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/tcp-vs-udp.svg "TCP vs UDP Communication")

In addition, TCP communications indicate the order in which data packets should be received and confirm that packets arrive as intended. If a packet does not arrive — e.g. due to congestion in intermediary networks — TCP requires that it be re-sent. UDP communications do not include any of this functionality.

These differences create some advantages. Because UDP does not require a ‘handshake’ or check whether data arrives properly, it is able to transfer data much faster than TCP.

However, this speed creates trade-offs. If a UDP datagram is lost in transit, it will not be re-sent. As a result, applications that use UDP must be able to tolerate errors, loss, and duplication.

(Technically, such packet loss is less a flaw in UDP than a consequence of how the Internet is built. Most network [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/) do not perform packet ordering and arrival confirmation by design, because doing so would require an unfeasible amount of additional memory. TCP is a way of filling this gap when an application requires it.)

## What is UDP used for?

UDP is commonly used in time-sensitive communications where occasionally dropping packets is better than waiting. Voice and video traffic are often sent using this protocol because they are both time-sensitive and designed to handle some level of loss. For example, [VoIP (voice over IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-voip/), which is used by many Internet-based telephone services, typically operates over UDP. This is because a static-y phone conversation is preferable to one that is crystal clear but heavily delayed.

This also makes UDP the ideal protocol for online gaming. Similarly, because DNS servers both need to be fast and efficient, they operate through UDP as well.

## Applications of UDP

- Used for simple request-response communication when the size of data is less and hence there is lesser concern about flow and error control.
- It is a suitable protocol for multicasting as UDP supports packet switching.
- UDP is used for some routing update protocols like [RIP(Routing Information Protocol).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/)
- Normally used for real-time applications which can not tolerate uneven delays between sections of a received message.
- [VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip/) services, such as Skype and WhatsApp, use UDP for real-time voice communication. The delay in voice communication can be noticeable if packets are delayed due to congestion control, so UDP is used to ensure fast and efficient data transmission.
- [DNS (Domain Name System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) also uses UDP for its query/response messages. DNS queries are typically small and require a quick response time, making UDP a suitable protocol for this application.
- [DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) uses UDP to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. DHCP messages are typically small, and the delay caused by packet loss or retransmission is generally not critical for this application.
- Following implementations uses UDP as a transport layer protocol: 
    - NTP (Network Time Protocol)
    - DNS (Domain Name Service)
    - BOOTP, DHCP.
    - NNP (Network News Protocol)
    - Quote of the day protocol
    - TFTP, RTSP, RIP.
- The application layer can do some of the tasks through UDP- 
    - Trace Route
    - Record Route
    - Timestamp
- UDP takes a datagram from [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-services-packetizing-routing-and-forwarding/), attaches its header, and sends it to the user. So, it works fast.

## TCP vs UDP

|Basis|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)|User Datagram Protocol (UDP)|
|---|---|---|
|Type of Service|[TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.|[UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is the Datagram-oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission.|
|Reliability|TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router.|The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.|
|Error checking mechanism|TCP provides extensive error-checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.|UDP has only the basic error-checking mechanism using checksums.|
|Acknowledgme nt|An acknowledgment segment is present.|No acknowledgment segment.|
|Sequence|Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in order at the receiver.|There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If the order is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.|
|Speed|TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.|UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP.|
|Retransmission|Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP.|There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).|
|Header Length|TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header.|UDP has an 8 bytes fixed-length header.|
|Weight|TCP is heavy-weight.|UDP is lightweight.|
|Handshaking Techniques|Uses handshakes such as SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK|It’s a connectionless protocol i.e. No handshake|
|Broadcasting|TCP doesn’t support Broadcasting.|UDP supports Broadcasting.|
|Protocols|TCP is used by [HTTP, HTTPs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https-2/), [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp/), [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/) and [Telnet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/).|UDP is used by DNS, DHCP, TFTP, [SNMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/), RIP, and VoIP.|
|Stream Type|The TCP connection is a byte stream.|UDP connection is a message stream.|
|Overhead|Low but higher than UDP.|Very low.|
|Applications|This protocol is primarily utilized in situations when a safe and trustworthy communication procedure is necessary, such as in email, on the web surfing, and in military services.|This protocol is used in situations where quick communication is necessary but where dependability is not a concern, such as VoIP, game streaming, video, and music streaming, etc.|

## Advantages of UDP
- **Speed:** UDP is faster than TCP because it does not have the overhead of establishing a connection and ensuring reliable data delivery.
- **Lower latency:** Since there is no connection establishment, there is lower latency and faster response time.
- **Simplicity:** UDP has a simpler protocol design than TCP, making it easier to implement and manage.
- **Broadcast support:*** UDP supports broadcasting to multiple recipients, making it useful for applications such as video streaming and online gaming.
- **Smaller packet size:** UDP uses smaller packet sizes than TCP, which can reduce network congestion and improve overall network performance.
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is more efficient in terms of both latency and bandwidth.

## Disadvantages of UDP

- **No reliability:** UDP does not guarantee delivery of packets or order of delivery, which can lead to missing or duplicate data.
- **No congestion control:** UDP does not have congestion control, which means that it can send packets at a rate that can cause network congestion.
- **Vulnerable to attacks:** UDP is vulnerable to [denial-of-service attacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deniel-service-prevention/), where an attacker can flood a network with UDP packets, overwhelming the network and causing it to crash.
- **Limited use cases:** UDP is not suitable for applications that require reliable data delivery, such as email or file transfers, and is better suited for applications that can tolerate some data loss, such as video streaming or online gaming.
