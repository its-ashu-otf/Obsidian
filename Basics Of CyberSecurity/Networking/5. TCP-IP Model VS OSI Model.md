## OSI Model VS TCP/IP Model

![[1698579140043-ezgif.com-crop (1).gif]]

## How is the OSI Model different from the TCP/IP model?

The [TCP/IP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) networking conceptual model is an alternative to the OSI Model. It divides the networking stack into four layers instead of seven, and although it is similar to the OSI Model, it does not match up exactly. In the TCP/IP model, there is no "layer 7," but this is a purely semantic distinction and does not mean that networking functions differently in the two models.

The four layers in the TCP/IP model are:

1. The application layer (for protocols such as HTTP and SMTP)
2. The transport layer (for transport protocols such as TCP and UDP)
3. The Internet layer (the [Internet protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-protocol/) and [ICMP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/))
4. The network access layer

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TCP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.                                                                           | OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection.                                                              |
| TCP/IP uses both the session and presentation layer in the application layer itself.                                   | OSI uses different session and presentation layers.                                                      |
| TCP/IP follows connectionless a horizontal approach.                                                                   | OSI follows a vertical approach.                                                                         |
| The Transport layer in TCP/IP does not provide assurance delivery of packets.                                          | In the OSI model, the transport layer provides assurance delivery of packets.                            |
| Protocols cannot be replaced easily in TCP/IP model.                                                                   | While in the OSI model, Protocols are better covered and are easy to replace with the technology change. |
| TCP/IP model network layer only provides connectionless (IP) services. The transport layer (TCP) provides connections. | Connectionless and connection-oriented services are provided by the network layer in the OSI model.      |
