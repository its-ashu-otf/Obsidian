## RANDOM Variable

In Bash, you can generate a random number using the built-in variable $RANDOM . It will return a random integer between 0 and 32767 which you can attach to a variable or print it to terminal with the syntax echo $RANDOM . 

This variable provides a simple and efficient way to create random numbers in your scripts.
* For Example:  `echo $RANDOM`

To limit the range of RANDOM generated variables.

`echo $(( $RANDOM % 10 ))`   ~ *This will limit it to 10 i.e. 0-9*

## Simple Math in BASH scripting

Math and arithmetic operations are essential in Bash scripting. Various automation tasks require basic arithmetic operations, such as converting the CPU temperature to Fahrenheit. Implementing math operations in Bash is simple and very easy to learn. Also known as **BASH MATH**.

## Arithmetic Expansion

The preferable way to do math in Bash is to use shell arithmetic expansion. The built-in capability evaluates math expressions and returns the result. The syntax for arithmetic expansions is:

```
$((expression))
```

The syntax consists of:

- Compound notation **`(())`** which evaluates the expression.
- The variable operator **`$`** to store the result.

For Example:
```
echo $((5+3))
```


> [!NOTE]
  The square bracket notation ( $[expression] ) also evaluates an arithmetic expression, and should be avoided since it is deprecated.	

### bc Command

The **`bc`** command (short for **b**asic **c**alculator) is a command-line utility that renders the bc language. The program runs as an interactive program or takes standard input to perform arbitrary precision arithmetic.

Pipe an equation from standard input into the command to fetch results. For example:

```
echo "2+3" | bc
```

The output prints the calculation result.

### declare Command

The Bash declare command allows integer calculations. To use **`declare`** for calculations, add the **`-i`** option. For example:

```
declare -i x=2 y=3 z=x+y
```

Echo each variable to see the results:

```
echo $x + $y = $z
```

The output prints each variable to the console.

### expr Command

The **`expr`** command is a legacy command line utility for evaluating integer arithmetic. An example **`expr`** command looks like the following:

```
expr 2 + 3
```

![expr addition terminal output](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/expr-addition-terminal-output.png)

Separate numbers and the operation sign with spaces and run the command to see the calculation result.

### factor Command

The **`factor`** command is a command-line utility that prints the factors for any positive integer, and the result factorizes into prime numbers.

For example, to print the factors of the number 100, run:

```
factor 100
```

![factor 100 terminal output](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/factor-100-terminal-output.png)

The output prints the factored number.

## Bash Arithmetic Operators

Bash offers a wide range of arithmetic operators for various calculations and evaluations. The operators work with the **`let`**, **`declare`**, and arithmetic expansion.

Below is a quick reference table that describes Bash arithmetic operators and their functionality.
