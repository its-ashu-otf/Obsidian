Variables are an important aspect of any programming language. Without variables, you will not be able to store any required data. With the help of variables, data is stored at a particular memory address and then it can be accessed as well as modified when required. 

> In Simple words a variable is a container that contain any data values.

To declare variable we use `<name of variable> = <value of it>`

For Example: `name=$(whoami)`

Example Script:

```
#!/bin/bash

name=$(whoami)

echo "Good Morning $name!"
sleep 1
echo "You're Looking good today $name!"
sleep 1
echo "You are the Best $name!"

```

## How to take inputs?

The syntax for the Bash read command is:

`read <options> <arguments>`

The read command takes the user input and splits the string into fields, assigning each new word to an argument. If there are fewer variables than words, read stores the remaining terms into the final variable.

Specifying the argument names is optional. The command stores a user's input into the $REPLY variable by default.

### Arguments

Save the user input into a specified variable by providing an argument:

Example Script:

```
#!/bin/bash
name=$1
echo "Good Morning $name"

```

To run this script

`bash ./scriptname.sh <anyname>`

This is a positional parameter A.K.A Argument. This is why we have written 1 in our script because its the first parameter.

## Advance things using Variables

Using variable to print outputs of command.

Example Script: 

```
#!/bin/bash

user=$(whoami)
echo"Good Evening $user"
```


## Rules for variable definition

 A variable name could contain any alphabet (a-z, A-Z), any digits (0-9), and an underscore ( _ ). However, a variable name must start with an alphabet or underscore. It can never start with a number. Following are some examples of valid and invalid variable names:

- ***Valid Variable Names**

`ABC`  
`_AV_3`  
`AV232`  

- **Invalid variable names** 

`2_AN`  
`!ABD`  
`$ABC`  
`&QAID`  

****Note:**** It must be noted that no other special character except underscore can be used in a variable name because all other special characters have special meanings in Shell Scripting.

## Unsetting Variables

The unset command directs a shell to delete a variable and its stored data from list of variables. It can be used as follows:

```
#!/bin/bash  
  
var1="Devil"  
var2=23  
echo $var1 $var2  
  
unset var1  
  
echo $var1 $var2  
```

***Output:**

DEVIL 23  
23

Example of Unsetting Variables

***Note:*** The unset command could not be used to unset read-only variables.

### Read only Variables.

These variables are read only i.e., their values could not be modified later in the script. Following is an example:

```
#!/bin/bash  
var1="Devil"  
var2=23  
readonly var1  
echo $var1 $var2  
var1=23  
echo $var1 $var2  
```

**Output:***

Devil 23  
./bash1: line 8: var1: readonly variable  
Devil 23

Example of Read only Variables.

Now let us see all the above codes in action together. Following is a shell script that includes all the shell variables discussed above.

```
#!/bin/bash  
Var_name="Devil"  
Var_age=23  
  
```
#### accessing the declared variables using $  

```
echo "Name is $Var_name, and age is $Var_age."  
```
  
#### read-only variables  
```
var_blood_group="O-"  
readonly var_blood_group  
echo "Blood group is $var_blood_group and read only."  
echo "Error for read only variables, if trying to \  
modify them."  
echo  
var_blood_group="B+"  
echo  
```
  
#### unsetting variables  
```
unset Var_age  
echo "After unsetting var_age..."  
echo  
echo "Name is $Var_name, blood group is $var_blood_group\  
 and age is $Var_age..."  

```

***Output:***

## Rules for Naming Variable Name

1. A variable name can have letters, numbers, and underscores
2. There should be no whitespace on either side of the assignment operator(=)
3. The  variable name cannot have special characters.
4. The first character of the variable name cannot be a number
5. Variable names cannot be reserved words
6. Variable name cannot have whitespace in between.
