Scripting is used to automate the execution of the tasks so that humans do not need to perform them individually. Bash scripting is a great way to automate different types of tasks in a system.

Bash scripting supports variables, conditional statements, and loops just like programming languages.

## Applications of Bash Scripts:
	-Manipulating files
	-Executing routine tasks like Backup operation
	-Automation


## Advantages of Bash Scripts:
	- It is simple.
	- It helps to avoid doing repetitive tasks
	- Easy to use
	- Frequently performed tasks can be automated
	- A sequence of commands can be run as a single command.



##  Disadvantages of Bash Scripts:
	- Any mistake while writing can be costly.
	- A new process launched for almost every shell command executed
	- Slow execution speed 
	- Compatibility problems between different platforms


# How to check which shell you're using?
-> `$ which $SHELL`  - this tells you which shell are you rocking. 

# How to Write Bash Scripts?

To write a Bash Script we will follow the steps: 
	1. First, we will create a file with the .sh extension.
	2. Next, we will write down the bash scripts within it
	3. After that, we will provide execution permission to it.

To create and write a file with the .sh extension we can use nano text editor.

$ nano scriptname.sh

The first line of our script file will be:
`#!/bin/bash`

This will tell, the system to use Bash for execution. `#!` this is called a shebang. It declares that this is a script. 

# Our First Script 

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello Ashu !"
```

Now we will save the file and provide the execution permission to it. To do so use the following command

	$ chmod +x scriptname.sh 

or you can do this too

	$ bash scriptname.sh
# Improving Our Script

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello Ashu !"

sleep 3 

echo "Good Morning !"

sleep 3  //this will give a 3 sec pause and then execute the next line

echo "How are you feeling today?"

```
