## String and Numeric Comparisons 

The string comparison means in the shell scripting we can take decisions by doing comparisons within strings as well. 

Here is a descriptive table with all the operators:

| Operator | Description                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ==       | Returns true if the strings are equal               |
| !=       | Returns true if the strings are not equal           |
| -n       | Returns true if the string to be tested is not null |
| -z       | Returns true if the string to be tested is null     |

Arithmetic operators are used for checking the arithmetic-based conditions. 
Like less than, greater than, equals to, etc. 
Here is a descriptive table with all the operators-


| Operator | Description           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| -eq      | Equal                 |
| -ge      | Greater Than or Equal |
| -gt      | Greater Than          |
| -le      | Less Than or Equal    |
| -lt      | Less Than             |
| -ne      | Not Equal             |
* Below is a simple example of the same- 

```
if [ 10 -eq 10 ];then
echo "Equal"
fi

if [ 'Geeks' == 'Geeks' ];
then
    echo "same" #output
else
    echo "not same"
fi

```

## `OR` Statements
Just like OR gate. If any one condition is true then the statement is executed.

* Example:
```
if[[ $name == $Shashank || $name == "Ashu" ]]; then
	echo "You're a Boy"
else
	echo "You're a Girl"
fi
```
