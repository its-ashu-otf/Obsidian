Attacks are typically categorized based on the action performed by the attacker. An attack, thus, can be **passive** or **active**.

## Passive Attacks

The main goal of a passive attack is to obtain **unauthorized access to the information**. For example, actions such as intercepting and eavesdropping on the communication channel can be regarded as passive attack.

These actions are passive in nature, as they neither affect information nor disrupt the communication channel. A passive attack is often seen as _stealing_ information. The only difference in stealing physical goods and stealing information is that theft of data still leaves the owner in possession of that data. Passive information attack is thus more dangerous than stealing of goods, as information theft may go unnoticed by the owner.

## Active Attacks

An active attack involves changing the information in some way by conducting some process on the information. For example,

- Modifying the information in an unauthorized manner.
    
- Initiating unintended or unauthorized transmission of information.
    
- Alteration of authentication data such as originator name or timestamp associated with information
    
- Unauthorized deletion of data.
    
- Denial of access to information for legitimate users (denial of service).

Cryptography provides many tools and techniques for implementing cryptosystems capable of preventing most of the attacks described above.

## Assumptions of Attacker

Let us see the prevailing environment around cryptosystems followed by the types of attacks employed to break these systems −

### Environment around Cryptosystem

While considering possible attacks on the cryptosystem, it is necessary to know the cryptosystems environment. The attacker’s assumptions and knowledge about the environment decides his capabilities.

In cryptography, the following three assumptions are made about the security environment and attacker’s capabilities.

### Details of the Encryption Scheme

The design of a cryptosystem is based on the following two cryptography algorithms −

- **Public Algorithms** − With this option, all the details of the algorithm are in the public domain, known to everyone.
    
- **Proprietary algorithms** − The details of the algorithm are only known by the system designers and users.
    

In case of proprietary algorithms, security is ensured through obscurity. Private algorithms may not be the strongest algorithms as they are developed in-house and may not be extensively investigated for weakness.

Secondly, they allow communication among closed group only. Hence they are not suitable for modern communication where people communicate with large number of known or unknown entities. Also, according to Kerckhoff’s principle, the algorithm is preferred to be public with strength of encryption lying in the _key_.

Thus, the first assumption about security environment is that the **encryption algorithm is known to the attacker**.

### Availability of Ciphertext

We know that once the plaintext is encrypted into ciphertext, it is put on unsecure public channel (say email) for transmission. Thus, the attacker can obviously assume that it has **access to the ciphertext generated by the cryptosystem**.

### Availability of Plaintext and Ciphertext

This assumption is not as obvious as other. However, there may be situations where an attacker can have **access to plaintext and corresponding ciphertext**. Some such possible circumstances are −

- The attacker influences the sender to convert plaintext of his choice and obtains the ciphertext.
    
- The receiver may divulge the plaintext to the attacker inadvertently. The attacker has access to corresponding ciphertext gathered from open channel.
    
- In a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is in open domain and is known to any potential attacker. Using this key, he can generate pairs of corresponding plaintexts and ciphertexts.
