# Public Key Encryption

Public key cryptography provides a secure way to exchange information and authenticate users by using pairs of keys. The public key is used for encryption and signature verification, while the private key is used for decryption and signing. When the two parties communicate with each other to transfer the intelligible or sensible message, referred to as plaintext, is converted into apparently random unreadable for security purposes referred to as ****ciphertext****. 

## What is Public Key Cryptography?

Public key cryptography is a method of secure communication that uses a pair of keys, a public key, which anyone can use to encrypt messages or verify signatures, and a private key, which is kept secret and used to decrypt messages or sign documents. This system ensures that only the intended recipient can read an encrypted message and that a signed message truly comes from the claimed sender. [Public key cryptography](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-public-key-cryptography/) is essential for secure internet communications, allowing for confidential messaging, authentication of identities, and verification of data integrity.

## What is a Cryptographic Key?

A cryptographic key is a piece of information used by cryptographic algorithms to encrypt or decrypt data, authenticate identities, or generate [digital signatures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signatures-certificates/). It serves as a parameter to control cryptographic operations, ensuring the security and privacy of digital communications and transactions.

## How Does TLS/SSL Use Public Key Cryptography?

TLS/SSL uses public key cryptography to keep our internet connections secure. It does this in two main ways:

1. ***Encryption****: When you visit a secure website ([HTTPS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/https-full-form/)), TLS/SSL helps encrypt data exchanged between your browser and the website’s server. It uses a combination of public and private keys to create a secure connection. Your browser and the server agree on a secret key for this session, which keeps your data safe from eavesdroppers.
2. ***Authentication****: TLS/SSL verifies the identity of websites. When you connect to a site, it presents a digital certificate signed by a trusted authority. Your browser checks this certificate to ensure you’re really connecting to the right site and not a fake one trying to steal your information.

By using public key cryptography, TLS/SSL protects our privacy online and ensures that the websites we visit are genuine and trustworthy.

## Encryption

The process of changing the plaintext into the ciphertext is referred to as **encryption.**   
The encryption process consists of an algorithm and a key. The key is a value independent of the plaintext.   
   
***The security of conventional encryption depends on the major two factors**

1. The Encryption algorithm
2. Secrecy of the key

## Decryption

The process of changing the ciphertext to the plaintext that process is known as ****decryption****. 

***Public Key Encryption :***  [Asymmetric](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymmetric-key-cryptography/) is a form of Cryptosystem in which encryption and decryption are performed using different keys-Public key (known to everyone) and Private key (Secret key). This is known as ****Public Key Encryption.****

## Difference Between Encryption and Public-Key Encryption

## Characteristics of Public Encryption key

- Public key Encryption is important because it is infeasible to determine the decryption key given only the knowledge of the cryptographic algorithm and encryption key.
- Either of the two keys (Public and Private key) can be used for encryption with other key used for decryption.
- Due to Public key cryptosystem, public keys can be freely shared, allowing users an easy and convenient method for encrypting content and verifying digital signatures, and private keys can be kept secret, ensuring only the owners of the private keys can decrypt content and create digital signatures.
- The most widely used public-key cryptosystem is [RSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/) (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). The difficulty of finding the prime factors of a composite number is the backbone of RSA.

Example: 
Public keys of every user are present in the Public key Register. If B wants to send a confidential message to C, then B encrypt the message using C Public key. When C receives the message from B then C can decrypt it using its own Private key. No other recipient other than C can decrypt the message because only C know C’s private key.
