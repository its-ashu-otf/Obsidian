### WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?

Just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with each other, we use a
programming language like Python to communicate with the computer.
Programming is a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks.

### WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a simple and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple
English. This Pseudo code nature is easy to learn and understandable by beginners.

##### FEATURES OF PYTHON
• Easy to understand = Less development time
• Free and open source
• High level language
• Portable: Works on Linux / Windows / Mac.
• Fun to work with!

### History

**1989**: Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer, starts working on a new programming language as a side project while he was at National Research Council (NRC) in Canada. He wants to create a language that is easy to learn and simple to use.

**1991**: Van Rossum begins writing the first version of Python, then called "Cython". The name "Python" comes from the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus, which he enjoyed watching.

**1994**: Python 0.9.1 is released as an open-source project. It becomes popular among researchers and students for its simplicity and readability.

**1995-2000**: Python gains traction in the scientific computing community, particularly with the introduction of libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

**2000s**: Python's popularity grows rapidly, driven by its ease of use, large standard library, and extensive collection of third-party libraries. It becomes a popular choice for web development (e.g., Django), data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

**2010s-present**: Python continues to evolve with the introduction of new features, such as type hinting (Python 3.5) and async/await syntax (Python 3.5). Its popularity grows even more, becoming one of the most widely taught programming languages in academia.

Today, Python is a versatile language used by millions of developers worldwide, known for its readability, simplicity, and extensive libraries.
