In Python, the "flow control statements" refer to the constructs that control the order of execution of the program's instructions. These statements determine how many times an instruction is executed or when it should be skipped.

# Types of Flow Control Statements
## Decision/ Selection Control Statement
- **if**
- **if else**
- **if elif else**

## Iterative/Loop Statement
- **while**
- **for**

**Decision Control Statements in Python**

Decision control statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to take different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

### 1. **if Statement**

The `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed.

**Syntax:** `if (condition):`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

### 2. **if-else Statement**

The `if-else` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code within the `else` block is executed.

**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something else:`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```

### 3. **if-elif-else Statement**

The `if-elif-else` statement is used to check multiple conditions in sequence.

**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something elif (another condition): # do another thing else:`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 4")
```

These decision control statements provide a simple way to make decisions in Python programs, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific conditions.

**Iterative/Loop Statements in Python**

Iterative/loop statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.

### 1. **while Loop**

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it's false, the loop terminates.

**Syntax:** `while (condition):`
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

### 2. **for Loop**

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list or a string.

**Syntax:** `for (variable) in (sequence):`
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Characteristics of Loops:

* **Repeatability**: Loops allow you to execute code multiple times.
* **Condition-based termination**: Loops can be terminated based on a specific condition.

### Types of Loops:

* **Infinite Loop**: A loop that runs indefinitely, without any termination condition. (Example: `while True:`)
* **Finite Loop**: A loop that runs for a specified number of iterations or until a certain condition is met.
* **Indexed Loop**: A loop that iterates over an indexed collection, such as a list or array.

**Loop Control Statements**

In addition to the `break` statement (used to exit a loop prematurely), Python also supports:

* **continue**: Used to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one.
* **pass**: A placeholder statement that can be used when no action is required in a specific case.

By using these iterative/loop statements, you can write efficient and readable code that repeats tasks or executes blocks of code based on specific conditions.

### Remember
- Switch is not available in python.
- do-while is also not available in python.
