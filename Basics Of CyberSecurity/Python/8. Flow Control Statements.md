In Python, the "flow control statements" refer to the constructs that control the order of execution of the program's instructions. These statements determine how many times an instruction is executed or when it should be skipped.

# Types of Flow Control Statements
## Decision/ Selection Control Statement
- **if**
- **if else**
- **if elif else**

## Iterative/Loop Statement
- **while**
- **for**

**Decision Control Statements in Python**

Decision control statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to take different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

### 1. **if Statement**

The `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed.

**Syntax:** `if (condition):`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

### 2. **if-else Statement**

The `if-else` statement is used to check if a condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code within the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code within the `else` block is executed.

**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something else:`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```

### 3. **if-elif-else Statement**

The `if-elif-else` statement is used to check multiple conditions in sequence.

**Syntax:** `if (condition): # do something elif (another condition): # do another thing else:`
```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 4")
```

These decision control statements provide a simple way to make decisions in Python programs, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific conditions.

**Iterative/Loop Statements in Python**

Iterative/loop statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.

### 1. **while Loop**

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it's false, the loop terminates.

**Syntax:** `while (condition):`
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

### 2. **for Loop**

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list or a string.

**Syntax:** `for (variable) in (sequence):`
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Characteristics of Loops:

* **Repeatability**: Loops allow you to execute code multiple times.
* **Condition-based termination**: Loops can be terminated based on a specific condition.

### Types of Loops:

* **Infinite Loop**: A loop that runs indefinitely, without any termination condition. (Example: `while True:`)
* **Finite Loop**: A loop that runs for a specified number of iterations or until a certain condition is met.
* **Indexed Loop**: A loop that iterates over an indexed collection, such as a list or array.

**Loop Control Statements**

In addition to the `break` statement (used to exit a loop prematurely), Python also supports:

* **continue**: Used to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one.
* **pass**: A placeholder statement that can be used when no action is required in a specific case.

By using these iterative/loop statements, you can write efficient and readable code that repeats tasks or executes blocks of code based on specific conditions.

### Remember
- Switch is not available in python.
- do-while is also not available in python.

## Transfer Statements
Transfer statements! Those are used to control the flow of a program by transferring execution from one part of the code to another. Here's a breakdown:

**Types of Transfer Statements**

There are three types of transfer statements in Python:

### 1. **Break Statement**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, i.e., it transfers control out of a loop. The loop is terminated immediately, and the program continues executing with the next line after the loop.

**Syntax:** `break`
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

### 2. **Continue Statement**

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and transfers control to the next iteration. It's useful when you want to skip some iterations based on certain conditions.

**Syntax:** `continue`
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### 3. **Pass Statement**

The `pass` statement is a placeholder that can be used when no action is required in a specific case. It doesn't do anything, but it's sometimes useful when you want to add something later or as a temporary fix.

**Syntax:** `pass`
```python
if True:
    pass  # No action needed here
```

**How Transfer Statements Work**

Transfer statements are used to transfer control from one part of the code to another. Here's how they work:

* `break`: Exits a loop prematurely, transferring control out of the loop.
* `continue`: Skips the current iteration of a loop and transfers control to the next iteration.
* `pass`: Does nothing, but can be used as a placeholder for future development or debugging.

**When to Use Transfer Statements**

Transfer statements are useful when you need to:

* Exit a loop prematurely due to some condition (e.g., `break`).
* Skip certain iterations of a loop based on conditions (e.g., `continue`).
* Add placeholders or temporary fixes without affecting the rest of the code (`pass`).

Remember, these transfer statements can help you write more efficient and readable code by controlling the flow of your program. Just be careful with their use to avoid unexpected behavior!
