Python modules!

In Python, a module is essentially a file that contains a collection of related functions, classes, and variables. Modules are used to organize code into smaller, more manageable chunks, making it easier to reuse and share functionality between different parts of a program.

Here's a breakdown of what you need to know about Python modules:

**Types of Modules:**

1. **Built-in Modules:** These are modules that come bundled with the Python interpreter itself, such as `math`, `random`, or `os`. You don't need to install them separately.
2. **External Modules (3rd Party):** These are modules created by other developers and made available for download through repositories like PyPI (Python Package Index). Examples include `numpy`, `pandas`, or `requests`.
3. **Custom Modules:** These are modules you create yourself, often to contain related functions or classes specific to your project.

**Key Features:**

1. **Importing:** To use a module's contents in your code, you import it using the `import` statement. For example: `import math`.
2. **Package Structure:** Modules can be grouped into packages, which are essentially directories containing multiple related modules. You can think of packages like folders that hold collections of modules.
3. **Module Attributes:** A module has attributes that reflect its contents, such as functions, classes, and variables.

**Common Module Usage:**

1. **Function Calls:** To use a function from a module, you call it using the module name followed by the function name. For example: `math.sin(x)`.
2. **Variable Access:** You can access variables directly by importing them or using the module name. For example: `import math; print(math.pi)`.
3. **Class Instantiation:** If a module defines classes, you can instantiate them as needed.

**Example Module Structure:**

Suppose we have a simple calculator program with separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We might create a module called `calculator.py` containing these functions:
```python
# calculator.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero!")
    return a / b
```

You can then import this module in your main script and use the functions as needed:
```python
# main.py

import calculator

print(calculator.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
print(calculator.divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
```
In summary, Python modules are a way to organize and reuse code by collecting related functions, classes, and variables into separate files or packages.

## Examples of External Modules
Here are some examples of popular External Modules (3rd Party) in Python:

1. **NumPy**: The NumPy module is a library for efficient numerical computation. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to manipulate them.
	* Example: `import numpy as np; print(np.pi)` (prints the value of pi)
2. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data analysis library that provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data.
	* Example: `import pandas as pd; df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]})` (creates a sample DataFrame)
3. **Requests**: The Requests module is an HTTP client for Python that allows you to send HTTP requests and retrieve responses.
	* Example: `import requests; response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')`
4. **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
	* Example: `from sklearn.datasets import load_iris; iris = load_iris()`
5. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library that allows you to create high-quality 2D plots.
	* Example: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`
6. **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library that provides functions for image and video processing, feature detection, and more.
	* Example: `import cv2; img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')`
7. **Scipy**: SciPy is a scientific computing library that provides functions for scientific and engineering applications, such as signal processing, linear algebra, and optimization.
	* Example: `from scipy import optimize; def func(x): return x**2 + 3*x - 4; res = optimize.root(func)`
8. **BeautifulSoup**: BeautifulSoup is a HTML parser that allows you to scrape data from web pages.
	* Example: `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup; soup = BeautifulSoup(html_string, 'html.parser')`
9. **pygame**: Pygame is a game development library that provides functions for graphics, sound, and input handling.
	* Example: `import pygame; pygame.init(); screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))`
10. **sqlite3**: The sqlite3 module is an SQL database library that allows you to interact with SQLite databases.
	* Example: `import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')` (creates a new in-memory database)

These are just a few examples of the many External Modules available for Python.
