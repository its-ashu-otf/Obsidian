### Module

In Python, a **module** (also called a package) is a collection of related functions, classes, variables, or other code that can be reused throughout your program.

Think of it like a library bookshelf:

* A **module** is like a single book on the shelf. It contains a specific set of information, but you can only read one book at a time.
* A **package**, on the other hand, is like a whole section of books on the shelf. It's a collection of multiple modules that work together to provide a more comprehensive solution.

Modules are often used to:

1. Group related functions or classes together for easier maintenance and reuse.
2. Hide implementation details from the rest of your code (encapsulation).
3. Provide access to external resources, like databases or APIs.
4. Implement specific functionality, such as file I/O or networking.

In Python, modules are usually stored in files with a `.py` extension and can be imported into other programs using the `import` statement.

Here's an example:

**math_module.py**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

**main_program.py**
```python
import math_module

result = math_module.add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5

result = math_module.multiply(4, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 20
```
In this example, `math_module` is a module that contains two functions: `add` and `multiply`. The `main_program` imports the `math_module` and uses its functions to perform calculations.

Modules can be bundled together into packages to create more complex software structures.

### Our First Program

Here is a classic "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
# Print a message to the screen
print("Hello, World!")
```

Let me explain what's happening here:

* `print()`: This is a built-in function in Python that outputs its argument (the thing inside the parentheses) to the screen.
* `"Hello, World!"`: This is the string of text we want to output. The quotes around it tell Python that it's a string.

To run this program, you can save it to a file with a `.py` extension (for example, `hello_world.py`) and then execute it using the Python interpreter.

Here are the steps:

1. Save the code in a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac).
2. Add a shebang line at the top (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) if you're on Linux or macOS.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension (for example, `hello_world.py`).
4. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Type `python hello_world.py` to execute the program.

This should output "Hello, World!" to the screen!

Note: If you're on Windows, you might need to use `python3` instead of just `python`. And if you're using a Python interpreter other than 3.x (like Python 2.x), the syntax might be slightly different.

### PIP

**Pip** (Python Package Installer) is a package manager for Python. It's used to install and manage external packages, libraries, and modules in your Python projects.

Think of pip like an app store for Python:

* You have a project where you want to use some external functionality.
* Instead of writing that functionality from scratch, you can install it using pip.
* Pip downloads the package from a repository (like the PyPI - Python Package Index), installs it locally on your system, and makes it available to your project.

Pip allows you to:

1. **Search** for packages by name or keywords.
2. **Install** packages directly into your project's environment.
3. **Update** existing packages to newer versions.
4. **List** all installed packages in a project.
5. **Uninstall** packages that are no longer needed.

Some common pip commands include:

* `pip install <package_name>`: Installs the package and its dependencies.
* `pip update <package_name>`: Updates the specified package to the latest version.
* `pip list`: Lists all installed packages in the current project environment.
* `pip uninstall <package_name>`: Uninstalls the specified package.

Here's an example:

You want to use the `requests` library for making HTTP requests. You can install it using pip:
```bash
$ pip install requests
```
Once installed, you can import and use the `requests` library in your Python project.

Pip is a fundamental tool for any Python developer, as it streamlines package management and makes it easy to work with external libraries and frameworks.

### TYPES OF MODULES
There are two types of modules in Python.
1. Built in Modules (Preinstalled in Python)
2. External Modules (Need to install using pip)
3. **Third-Party Modules**: These are modules developed by external parties, not part of the standard library. They can be installed using pip from various sources like PyPI (Python Package Index). Examples include `requests`,
Some examples of built in modules are os, random etc.
Some examples of external modules are tensorflow, flask etc.

Here are some basic types of modules:

1. **Math Module**: A math module provides functions for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and trigonometry.

Example:
```python
import math

result = math.pi  # Get the value of pi
print(result)
```

2. **Time Module**: The time module provides functions for manipulating dates and times in Python.

Example:
```python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()
print(now)  # Print the current date and time
```

3. **Random Number Generator Module**: A random number generator module generates random numbers within a specified range or distribution.

Example:
```python
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(random_number)  # Print a random integer between 1 and 100
```

4. **String Manipulation Module**: A string manipulation module provides functions for manipulating strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and searching.

Example:
```python
import re

text = "Hello World"
result = re.split(" ", text)
print(result)  # Split the string into a list of words
```

5. **File Input/Output Module**: A file input/output module provides functions for reading from and writing to files in Python.

Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)  # Read the contents of a file
```

6. **System Information Module**: The system information module provides functions for retrieving system-specific information, such as the operating system, platform, and processor.

Example:
```python
import sys

os_name = sys.platform
print(os_name)  # Print the name of the operating system
```

These are just a few examples of basic modules that you might use in Python. There are many other types of modules available for more specialized tasks!

#### USING PYTHON AS A CALCULATOR
We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + ↵ on the terminal.
This opens REPL or Read Evaluate Print Loop.

#### COMMENTS
Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to
execute. This can be used to mark author name, date etc.
#### TYPES OF COMMENTS
There are two types of comments in python.
1. Single Line Comments: To write a single line comment just add a ‘#’ at the start
of the line.
```
# This is a Single-Line Comment
```
2. Multiline Comments: To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line
or you can use the multiline string (""" """)
```
"""This is an amazing
example of a Multiline
comment!"""
```
