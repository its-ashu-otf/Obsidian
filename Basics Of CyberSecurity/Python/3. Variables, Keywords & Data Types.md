## VARIABLES

**Variables** are containers where we can store values (like numbers, words, or even pictures). Think of them as labelled boxes:

1. **Box (Variable)**: A container with a name.
2. **Content (Value)**: The actual value stored inside the box.

Here's an analogy to make it clearer:

Imagine you have a bunch of identical-looking containers (like empty boxes) in your kitchen. You can label each one (e.g., "Bread", "Eggs", "Milk") and then store a corresponding item (like a loaf of bread, eggs, or a carton of milk) inside the box.

In programming, variables work similarly:

1. We create a variable (box) with a name (label).
2. We assign a value (content) to that variable.
3. The variable now holds that value until we change it.

Example:

* **Variable:** `age`
* **Value:** `25`

So, the `age` variable stores the value `25`.

In simple words, variables are like labelled containers where you can store values and use them later in your code!

## DATA TYPES

> [!NOTE] NOTE
>Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

**Data Types** in Python are categories that define the type of value a variable or expression can hold. Here are the main data types in Python:

1. **Integers (int)**: Whole numbers, without decimals. Examples: `1`, `-5`, `0`.
2. **Floats (float)**: Numbers with decimal points. Examples: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `12.3`.
3. **Complex Numbers (complex)**: Numbers that have a real and imaginary part. Example: `3 + 4j` (where `j` is the imaginary unit).
4. **Strings (str)**: Sequences of characters, such as words or phrases. Examples: `"Hello"`, `'Python'`.
5. **Boolean (bool)**: A logical value that can be either `True` or `False`.
6. **Nun:** To define null data type.
These data types can be combined in various ways using operators and functions to create more complex data structures.

Here's a simple example:

```python
name = "John"
age = 30

print(name)     # Output: John
print(age)      # Output: 30
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(age))   # Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Identifier

 In programming, an identifier (also known as a variable name) is a name given to a variable, function, class, or any other programming entity that holds a value. Identifiers are used to reference and access the values stored in variables.

Think of identifiers like labels on boxes:

1. **Box (Variable)**: A container where a value is stored.
2. **Label (Identifier)**: The name given to the box to identify it.

Here's an analogy to make it clearer:

Imagine you have a bunch of identical-looking containers (like empty boxes) in your kitchen. You can label each one (e.g., "Bread", "Eggs", "Milk") and then store a corresponding item (like a loaf of bread, eggs, or a carton of milk) inside the box.

In programming, identifiers work similarly:

1. We create an identifier (label) for a variable.
2. We assign a value to that variable using its identifier.
3. The identifier is used to reference and access the value stored in the variable.

**Example**:
```python
name = "John"
age = 30
```
Here, `name` and `age` are identifiers (variable names) assigned to variables holding values `"John"` and `30`, respectively.

## RULES FOR CHOOSING AN IDENTIFIER

In this example, we create a string variable `name` and an integer variable `age`, then print their values along with their respective data types using the `type()` function.

**Identifier Rules** are guidelines that help you choose valid names (identifiers) for variables, functions, classes, and other programming entities. Here are some rules to follow:

1. **Valid Characters**: Identifiers can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
2. **Start with a Letter or Underscore**: An identifier must start with either a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) character.
3. **No Special Characters**: Avoid using special characters like $, %, ^, &, *, +, -, =, etc., in identifiers.
4. **Maximum Length**: The maximum length for an identifier varies depending on the programming language, but most languages allow up to 32 characters (including underscores).
5. **No Keywords**: You cannot use keywords from your programming language as identifiers. For example, if you're using Python, you can't use `class`, `def`, or `if` as variable names.
6. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Choose names that are clear and unambiguous to avoid confusion later in your code.
7. **Follow Conventions**: Adhere to the naming conventions used in your language or project (e.g., camelCase, underscore notation).

Here are some examples of valid identifiers:

* `helloWorld`
* `_variable`
* `myFunction`
* `exampleClass`

And here are some examples of invalid identifiers:

* `1Hello` (starts with a digit)
* `$variable` (uses special character $)
* `a+b` (contains an operator +)

By following these rules, you can create clear, concise, and meaningful names for your programming entities.

Here's an example in Python:
```python
# Valid identifiers:
hello_world = "Hello World"
my_function = lambda x: x * 2

# Invalid identifier:
# hello1 (starts with a digit)
# $variable (uses special character $)

print(hello_world)  # Output: Hello World
print(my_function(5))  # Output: 10
```

### Dynamically Typed

**Dynamic Typing in Python**: In Python, variables do not have a fixed type at the time of their declaration. The type of an object can change during the execution of the program.

This means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it. Instead, Python infers the type based on the value assigned to it.

Here's an example:
```python
x = 5  # integer

print(type(x))  # output: <class 'int'>

x = "hello"  # string

print(type(x))  # output: <class 'str'>
```
As you can see, `x` is initially assigned an integer value of `5`, and its type is inferred as `int`. Later, when we assign a string value `"hello"` to `x`, Python infers the new type as `str`.

This dynamic typing allows for greater flexibility in programming. You don't need to worry about declaring the correct type at the start; Python will take care of it for you.

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **String concatenation**: When combining strings, Python automatically promotes one of them to a string if necessary.
```python
name = "John"
age = 30

print("Hello, my name is " + str(name) + " and I am " + str(age))  
# output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30
```
2. **Dynamic attribute access**: When accessing attributes of an object, Python will create them if they don't exist.
```python
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()
print(p.name)  # raises AttributeError
p.name = "John"
print(p.name)  # output: John
```
3. **Functions and methods**: Function arguments can be dynamically typed.
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + str(name))

greet(5)  # prints Hello, 5
```
However, it's worth noting that while dynamic typing offers flexibility, it also comes with some trade-offs:

* **Debugging challenges**: It can be harder to catch type-related errors when using dynamically typed variables.
* **Code readability**: Dynamic typing might lead to code that is less readable or self-documenting.

To mitigate these issues, Python provides a set of tools and best practices for dealing with dynamic typing effectively. Some of the most common include:

* Using type hints (e.g., `my_var: str`)
* Utilizing static type checkers like mypy
* Writing unit tests to verify behavior
* Documenting assumptions about variable types in code comments

By being aware of these aspects, you can harness the benefits of Python's dynamic typing while avoiding its pitfalls.

## Keywords

In Python, keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings in the language. They cannot be used as regular variable names or function names.

Here is a comprehensive list of Python keywords:

1. **Assignment Operators**:
	* `and` (logical AND)
	* `as` (alias for an expression)
	* `assert` (evaluation of a condition)
	* `async` (asyncio: asynchronous execution)
2. **Boolean Operators**:
	* `del` (deletion of an object or attribute)
	* `in` (membership test)
3. **Comparison Operators**:
	* `is` (identity comparison)
4. **Logical Operators**:
	* `not` (logical NOT)
5. **Membership Test Operators**:
	* `is not` (non-membership test)
6. **Arithmetic Operators**:
	* `with` (execution of a block of code with an arbitrary context manager)
7. **Control Flow Operators**:
	* `break` (exit from a loop or switch statement)
	* `continue` (skip to the next iteration in a loop)
8. **Functions and Classes**:
	* `def` (function definition)
9. **Exceptions**:
	* `except` (catching an exception)
	* `finally` (cleanup code for try-except blocks)
10. **Iteration and Looping**:
	* `for` (iteration over a sequence or other iterable)
11. **Type Conversion and Casting**:
	* `None` (a special type indicating the absence of value)

These keywords are used in various contexts, such as:

* Control flow statements (e.g., `if`, `while`, `for`)
* Function definitions (e.g., `def`)
* Class definitions (e.g., `class`)
* Exception handling (e.g., `try`, `except`)
* Type conversion and casting (e.g., `int()`, `str()`)

It's essential to remember that these keywords cannot be used as regular variable names or function names, so you should avoid using them in your code unless they're part of a built-in Python construct.
