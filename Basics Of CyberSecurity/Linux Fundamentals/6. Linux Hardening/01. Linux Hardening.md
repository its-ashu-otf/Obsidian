## **Fundamentals of Securing a Linux System**

All computer systems have an inherent risk of intrusion. Some systems, such as internet-facing web servers hosting multiple complex applications, present more risk than others. While Linux systems are generally less prone to viruses compared to Windows and have a smaller attack surface than Active Directory domain-joined hosts, securing them remains essential.

### **Keeping the OS and Installed Packages Updated**

One of the most important security measures is ensuring the operating system and installed packages are up to date. This can be achieved using the following command:

```bash
apt update && apt dist-upgrade
```

### **Configuring Firewalls**

If firewall rules are not appropriately set at the network level, Linux firewall tools such as `iptables` or `ufw` can be used to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.

### **Securing SSH Access**

If SSH is enabled on the server, the following best practices should be followed:

- **Disallow password authentication** to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Disable root login via SSH** to minimize risk.
- **Use key-based authentication** for better security.
- **Restrict user access based on the principle of least privilege.**

Instead of granting full `sudo` rights, specific commands should be defined in the `sudoers` file.

### **Using Fail2Ban for Intrusion Prevention**

Fail2Ban is a tool that monitors failed login attempts and temporarily bans hosts that exceed a configured number of failures. This helps prevent brute-force attacks.

### **Periodic Security Audits**

Regular system audits help identify potential security risks, including:

- Out-of-date kernels that require manual updates.
- Incorrect user permissions.
- World-writable files.
- Misconfigured cron jobs and services.

### **Using Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Systems**

Additional security can be implemented using:

- **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**: Applies granular access controls by labeling processes and objects and enforcing security policies through the kernel.
- **AppArmor**: Provides security confinement for individual applications.

### **Additional Security Measures**

Other security tools and best practices include:

- **Security applications**: Snort, chkrootkit, rkhunter, Lynis, and more.
- **Disabling unnecessary services and software** to reduce attack surface.
- **Removing services relying on unencrypted authentication mechanisms.**
- **Ensuring NTP is enabled and Syslog is running** for logging and time synchronization.
- **Enforcing strong password policies** and enabling password aging.
- **Locking user accounts after failed login attempts.**
- **Disabling unnecessary SUID/SGID binaries** to prevent privilege escalation.

Security is a continuous process. Administrators must stay informed about threats and understand their operating systems to implement effective security measures.

## **TCP Wrappers for Access Control**

TCP Wrappers provide an additional security mechanism in Linux by controlling access to services based on the requesting host's IP address.

### **Configuration Files**

- **`/etc/hosts.allow`**: Specifies services and hosts allowed to access the system.
- **`/etc/hosts.deny`**: Specifies services and hosts denied access.

### **Example Configuration**

#### **`/etc/hosts.allow`**

```bash
# Allow SSH access from the local network
sshd : 10.129.14.0/24

# Allow FTP access from a specific host
ftpd : 10.129.14.10

# Allow Telnet access from the inlanefreight.local domain
telnetd : .inlanefreight.local
```

#### **`/etc/hosts.deny`**

```bash
# Deny all services from the inlanefreight.com domain
ALL : .inlanefreight.com

# Deny SSH access from a specific host
sshd : 10.129.22.22

# Deny FTP access from the 10.129.22.0/24 subnet
ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```

### **Important Considerations**

- **Rule order matters**: The first matching rule in either file is applied.
- **TCP Wrappers are not a replacement for a firewall**: They provide host-based access control but should be used alongside network firewalls.
