Whether working as a system administrator, maintaining personal Linux machines, or managing a penetration testing distribution, having a strong understanding of Linux package managers is essential. These tools allow us to install, update, and remove software efficiently.

### **Understanding Package Management Systems**

A package is an archive containing software binaries, configuration files, dependency information, and update tracking details. Most package management systems provide the following key features:

- **Package Downloading** – Fetching software packages from repositories.
- **Dependency Resolution** – Ensuring all required dependencies are installed.
- **Standard Binary Package Format** – Common formats such as `.deb` and `.rpm`.
- **Consistent Installation & Configuration Locations** – Organizing files in predefined directories.
- **System Integration & Configuration Management** – Adapting software to the system’s environment.
- **Quality Control** – Verifying package integrity and security.

### **How Package Managers Work**

Package managers streamline software installation by retrieving and implementing the necessary system changes. If a package requires additional dependencies, the package manager either notifies the administrator or attempts to fetch and install them automatically.

Similarly, when software is removed, the package manager ensures that associated files and configurations are properly deleted.

If an installed software has been deleted, the package management system then retakes the package's information, modifies it based on its configuration, and deletes files. There are different package management programs that we can use for this. Here is a list of examples of such programs:

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dpkg`|A tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is `aptitude`.|
|`apt`|Provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system.|
|`aptitude`|An alternative to `apt`, offering a high-level interface to the package manager.|
|`snap`|Installs, configures, refreshes, and removes Snap packages. Snaps enable secure distribution of apps and utilities across cloud, server, desktop, and IoT environments.|
|`gem`|The front-end for RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby.|
|`pip`|A package installer for Python, recommended for installing Python packages not available in the Debian archive. Supports version control repositories (Git, Mercurial, Bazaar) and ensures reliable installations.|
|`git`|A fast, scalable, distributed version control system with an extensive command set for high-level operations and internal access.|

To experiment with these commands, it is highly recommended to set up a **local virtual machine (VM)**. Let's begin by installing Git using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install git -y
```

# **Advanced Package Manager (APT)**

Debian-based Linux distributions utilize the **APT (Advanced Package Tool)** for package management. A package is an archive file that contains multiple `.deb` files. The `dpkg` utility installs software from a `.deb` file, but managing dependencies manually can be cumbersome. APT simplifies this process by automatically resolving and installing required dependencies.

## **Software Repositories**

Each Linux distribution uses **software repositories**, which are frequently updated. When installing or updating software, the system queries these repositories for the necessary packages. Repositories are categorized as:

- **Stable** – Recommended for most users due to reliability.
- **Testing** – Features newer software but may have minor issues.
- **Unstable** – Contains cutting-edge software but may be prone to bugs.

To check the configured repositories, view the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. For example, in **Parrot OS**, repositories are stored in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list`:

```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list
```

Example output:

```bash
# parrot repository
# this file was automatically generated by parrot-mirror-selector
deb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free
deb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free
```

## **APT Cache**

APT maintains a local database, known as the **APT cache**, which stores metadata about installed and available packages. This allows users to search for packages offline.

### **Searching for a Package**

To search for a package (e.g., `impacket`), use:

```bash
apt-cache search impacket
```

Example output:

```bash
impacket-scripts - Links to useful impacket script examples
polenum - Extracts the password policy from a Windows system
python3-impacket - Python3 module to easily build and dissect network protocols
```

### **Viewing Package Details**

To view more details about a specific package:

```bash
apt-cache show impacket-scripts
```

Example output:

```bash
Package: impacket-scripts
Version: 1.4
Architecture: all
Maintainer: Kali Developers <devel@kali.org>
Depends: python3-impacket (>= 0.9.20), python3-ldap3 (>= 2.5.0), python3-ldapdomaindump
Size: 2080
```

## **Listing Installed Packages**

To list all installed packages:

```bash
apt list --installed
```

Example output (truncated):

```bash
Listing... Done
accountsservice/rolling,now 0.6.55-2 amd64 [installed,automatic]
adapta-gtk-theme/rolling,now 3.95.0.11-1 all [installed]
adduser/rolling,now 3.118 all [installed]
aircrack-ng/rolling,now 1:1.6-4 amd64 [installed,automatic]
```

## **Installing a Package**

If a package is missing, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y
```

Example output:

```bash
Reading package lists... Done

Reading state information... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:

# # **Git**

Now that we have `git` installed, we can use it to download useful tools from GitHub. One such project is called 'Nishang'. We will deal with and work with the project itself later. First, we need to navigate to the [project's repository](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) and copy the GitHub link before using git to download it.

# **Downloading and Installing Software Using Git and DPKG**

## **Cloning a Git Repository**

Before downloading a project and its scripts, it's a good practice to create a dedicated folder. For example, to clone the **Nishang** repository:

```bash
mkdir ~/nishang/ && git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang
```

**Example output:**

```
Cloning into '/opt/nishang/'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.
remote: Total 1691 (delta 4), reused 6 (delta 2), pack-reused 1676
Receiving objects: 100% (1691/1691), 7.84 MiB | 4.86 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1055/1055), done.
```

# **Using DPKG for Manual Package Installation**

### **Downloading a Debian Package Manually**

Sometimes, we may need to manually download a `.deb` package instead of using a package manager like `apt`. For instance, we can download **strace** for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `wget`:

```bash
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

**Example output:**

```

```

### **Installing a Debian Package with DPKG**

Now that we have the `.deb` file, we can install it using `dpkg`:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

**Example output:**

```
(Reading database ... 154680 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking strace (4.21-1ubuntu1) over (4.21-1ubuntu1) ...
Setting up strace (4.21-1ubuntu1) ...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.3-2ubuntu0.1) ...
```

If there are missing dependencies, we can resolve them by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```

---

### **Verifying the Installation**

To confirm that `strace` is installed and working, check its help menu:

```bash
strace -h
```

**Example output (truncated):**

```
usage: strace [-CdffhiqrtttTvVwxxy] [-I n] [-e expr]...
              [-a column] [-o file] [-s strsize] [-P path]...
              -p pid... / [-D] [-E var=val]... [-u username] PROG [ARGS]
Output format:
  -a column      alignment COLUMN for printing syscall results (default 40)
  -i             print instruction pointer at time of syscall
```

---

### **Conclusion**

Using `dpkg`, we can manually download and install `.deb` packages when necessary. However, it does not handle dependencies automatically like `apt`, making `apt` the preferred choice for package management in most cases.
