Containerization is the process of packaging and running applications in isolated environments known as **containers**. These containers bundle an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different systems, while sharing the host’s kernel. This makes them lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs), which require a full OS per instance.

---

## 1. Containerization Fundamentals

- **Definition & Benefits:**
    
    - **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, minimizing conflicts.
    - **Portability:** Containers include all required dependencies.
    - **Scalability & Efficiency:** Lightweight design allows multiple containers to run on the same host.
- **Analogy – The Concert Stage:**
    
    - Imagine organizing a concert where each band needs its own stage setup.
    - Instead of building an entirely new stage for each band (like spinning up a VM), you use portable, self-contained “stage pods” that are lightweight, reusable, and isolated—yet all share the same main stage (host system).
- **Security Considerations:**
    
    - **Isolation:** Containers reduce the risk of one application interfering with another.
    - **Risks:** Despite isolation, misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or container escapes.
    - **Best Practice:** Use additional hardening and security measures alongside container configurations.

## 2. Docker

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates application deployment in containers. It uses a layered file-system and resource isolation features, making it highly flexible and portable.

- **Key Concept:**  
    Think of a Docker container as a **sealed lunchbox**:
    - The contents (application and its dependencies) are self-contained.
    - When you “close” the container, it resets.
    - To update, you create a new recipe (Dockerfile) based on the original.

### Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu

Below is a script that updates the system, installs prerequisites, and sets up Docker:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Preparation
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y

# Add user htb-student to the Docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker htb-student
echo '[!] You need to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.'

# Test Docker installation
docker run hello-world
```

### Docker Images and Containers

- **Images:** Read-only templates that include the file-system and parameters needed for runtime.
- **Containers:** Running processes created from these images.

### Creating a Docker Image with a Dockerfile

Here’s an example Dockerfile based on Ubuntu 22.04 with Apache and SSH installed:

```dockerfile
# Use the latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Update package repository and install required packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
        apache2 \
        openssh-server \
        && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a new user called "docker-user"
RUN useradd -m docker-user && \
    echo "docker-user:password" | chpasswd

# Give docker-user full access to Apache and SSH services
RUN chown -R docker-user:docker-user /var/www/html && \
    chown -R docker-user:docker-user /var/run/apache2 && \
    chown -R docker-user:docker-user /var/log/apache2 && \
    chown -R docker-user:docker-user /var/lock/apache2 && \
    usermod -aG sudo docker-user && \
    echo "docker-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

# Expose required ports
EXPOSE 22 80

# Start SSH and Apache services
CMD service ssh start && /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
```

### Building and Running Docker Containers

- **Building an Image:**
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t FS_docker .
    ```
    
    This command reads the Dockerfile in the current directory, executes each step, and tags the resulting image as `FS_docker`.
    
- **Running a Container:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8022:22 -p 8080:80 -d FS_docker
    ```
    
    This maps host ports 8022 and 8080 to container ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP), respectively, running the container in the background.
    

### Docker Management Commands

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`docker ps`|List all running containers|
|`docker stop`|Stop a running container|
|`docker start`|Start a stopped container|
|`docker restart`|Restart a running container|
|`docker rm`|Remove a container|
|`docker rmi`|Remove a Docker image|
|`docker logs`|View the logs of a container|

> **Remember:** Changes made within a running container are not saved to the image unless a new image is built. Use volumes to persist data across container restarts.

## 3. Linux Containers (LXC)

### What is LXC?

Linux Containers (LXC) offer lightweight virtualization by running multiple isolated Linux systems on a single host. LXC leverages Linux kernel features such as **cgroups** and **namespaces** to isolate processes, networks, and filesystems.

### Docker vs. LXC

While both provide containerization, they differ in several key areas:

|**Category**|**LXC**|**Docker**|
|---|---|---|
|**Approach**|System-level containerization (lightweight VMs)|Application-centric (packaging single apps/microservices)|
|**Image Building**|Manual setup of root filesystem and configurations|Standardized Dockerfile builds complete images|
|**Portability**|More tightly tied to host system configuration|Highly portable via Docker Hub and registries|
|**Ease of Use**|May require in-depth Linux knowledge|User-friendly CLI with extensive community support|
|**Security**|Secure with proper configuration but may need extra measures|Generally more secure by default with extra isolation layers|

### Installing LXC on Ubuntu

Install LXC and its utilities using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install lxc lxc-utils -y
```

### Creating and Managing an LXC Container

- **Creating a Container:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo lxc-create -n linuxcontainer -t ubuntu
    ```
    
    This creates a new Ubuntu container named `linuxcontainer`.
    
- **Common LXC Management Commands:**
    
    |**Command**|**Description**|
    |---|---|
    |`lxc-ls`|List all existing containers|
    |`lxc-stop -n <container>`|Stop a running container|
    |`lxc-start -n <container>`|Start a stopped container|
    |`lxc-restart -n <container>`|Restart a running container|
    |`lxc-config -n <container> -s storage`|Manage container storage settings|
    |`lxc-config -n <container> -s network`|Manage container network settings|
    |`lxc-config -n <container> -s security`|Manage container security settings|
    |`lxc-attach -n <container>`|Connect to a container|
    |`lxc-attach -n <container> -f /path/to/share`|Connect and share a specific directory or file|
    

### Securing LXC with Resource Limits

Using **cgroups**, you can restrict resources for an LXC container. For example, create a configuration file for a container named `linuxcontainer`:

1. Open or create the configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim /usr/share/lxc/config/linuxcontainer.conf
    ```
    
2. Add resource limit parameters:
    
    ```txt
    lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares = 512
    lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes = 512M
    ```
    
    - **lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares:** A lower value (e.g., 512) means the container gets half the CPU time compared to the default (1024).
    - **lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes:** Sets the maximum memory usage (e.g., 512M).
3. Save the file and restart the LXC service:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart lxc.service
    ```
    

### Understanding Namespaces

Namespaces in Linux create isolated environments for:

- **Process IDs (pid):** Separate process trees for containers.
- **Network (net):** Isolated network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.
- **Mount (mnt):** Unique root filesystems for containers.

> **Key Point:** Although namespaces provide strong isolation, they are not a complete security solution. Always implement additional security measures.

## 4. Optional Exercises for LXC Practice

1. **Install LXC** on your machine and create your first container.
2. **Configure the network settings** for your LXC container.
3. **Create a custom LXC image** and use it to launch a new container.
4. **Configure resource limits** for your LXC containers (CPU, memory, disk space).
5. **Explore the lxc-*** commands for managing containers.
6. **Use LXC to create a container** running a specific version of a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
7. **Configure SSH access** to your LXC containers and connect to them remotely.
8. **Create a container with persistence** so that changes are saved and reused.
9. **Use LXC to test software** in a controlled environment (e.g., a vulnerable web application or malware).

## 5. Points Worth Remembering

- **Containerization Essentials:**
    
    - **Isolation & Portability:** Containers package all dependencies to run uniformly across environments.
    - **Resource Efficiency:** Sharing the host kernel makes containers lightweight compared to VMs.
- **Docker Highlights:**
    
    - **Ease of Use:** Docker’s CLI, Docker Hub, and Docker Compose/Kubernetes streamline container management.
    - **Stateless Nature:** Containers do not persist changes by default—use volumes for persistence.
    - **Image Building:** Dockerfiles provide a repeatable and versioned method to build images.
- **LXC Essentials:**
    
    - **System-Level Containers:** LXC provides a more traditional, system-level containerization using namespaces and cgroups.
    - **Security & Customization:** Proper configuration (e.g., resource limits, network settings) is crucial for maintaining security.
    - **Differences from Docker:** LXC is less portable and requires more manual setup, but it offers granular control over the system environment.
- **General Security Note:**
    
    - **Mitigate Risks:** Always apply best practices for security (e.g., minimal privilege, regular updates) to both Docker and LXC containers to prevent privilege escalation or container escapes.
