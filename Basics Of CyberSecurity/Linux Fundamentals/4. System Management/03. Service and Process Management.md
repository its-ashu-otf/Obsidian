## Understanding Services (Daemons)

Services, also known as daemons, are fundamental components of a Linux system that run in the background without direct user interaction. They perform essential tasks to maintain system operations and provide additional functionalities. Services are generally categorized into two types:

### 1. System Services

These are critical internal services required during system startup. They perform essential hardware-related tasks and initialize components necessary for the operating system to function properly. Think of them as a car's engine and transmission system—without them, the car wouldn't operate.

### 2. User-Installed Services

These services are added by users, often including server applications and background processes that provide specific functionalities. They are similar to a car's air conditioning or GPS—non-essential for the car to run but enhancing the overall experience.

Daemons are often identified by the letter 'd' at the end of their program names, such as `sshd` (SSH daemon) or `systemd`.

## Managing Services and Processes

When dealing with services or processes, the common objectives are:

- **Starting/Restarting a service/process**
- **Stopping a service/process**
- **Checking the status of a service/process**
- **Enabling/Disabling a service/process at boot**
- **Finding a service/process**

Most modern Linux distributions use **systemd** as their initialization system. It is the first process that starts during boot and is assigned Process ID (PID) 1. All other processes are assigned a unique PID, and they may also have a Parent Process ID (PPID) if they were started by another process.

### Using `systemctl`

#### Starting a Service

```bash
systemctl start ssh
```

#### Checking the Status of a Service

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

Example Output:

```
● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-05-14 15:08:23 CEST; 24h ago
   Main PID: 846 (sshd)
   Tasks: 1 (limit: 4681)
   CGroup: /system.slice/ssh.service
           └─846 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

#### Enabling a Service at Boot

```bash
systemctl enable ssh
```

#### Listing All Active Services

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

### Viewing Logs with `journalctl`

If a service fails to start, use `journalctl` to inspect logs:

```bash
journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager
```

---

## Process Management

A process can exist in the following states:

- **Running**
- **Waiting** (awaiting an event or resource)
- **Stopped**
- **Zombie** (terminated but still listed in the process table)

### Finding a Process

```bash
ps -aux | grep ssh
```

Example Output:

```
root       846  0.0  0.1  72300  5660 ?        Ss   Mai14   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
```

### Killing a Process

Processes can be controlled using `kill`, `pkill`, `pgrep`, and `killall`. To view all available signals:

```bash
kill -l
```

Common signals:

| Signal       | Description                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| SIGHUP (1)   | Terminal closed                  |
| SIGINT (2)   | Interrupt (Ctrl + C)             |
| SIGQUIT (3)  | Quit (Ctrl + D)                  |
| SIGKILL (9)  | Force kill a process             |
| SIGTERM (15) | Graceful termination             |
| SIGSTOP (19) | Stop process (cannot be handled) |
| SIGTSTP (20) | Suspend process (Ctrl + Z)       |

To kill a process forcefully:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

---

## Background and Foreground Processes

### Suspending a Process

Pressing `[Ctrl + Z]` suspends a process:

```bash
ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu
[Ctrl + Z]
```

Check background processes:

```bash
jobs
```

### Resuming a Suspended Process

- **Resume in the background:**
    
    ```bash
    bg
    ```
    
- **Bring it back to the foreground:**
    
    ```bash
    fg <job ID>
    ```
    

To run a command directly in the background:

```bash
ping -c 10 www.hackthebox.eu &
```

---

## Running Multiple Commands

Three operators can be used to execute multiple commands:

### 1. Semicolon (`;`)

Executes commands sequentially, ignoring errors:

```bash
echo '1'; echo '2'; echo '3'
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

### 2. Double Ampersand (`&&`)

Executes the next command only if the previous one succeeds:

```bash
echo '1' && ls MISSING_FILE && echo '3'
```

Output:

```
1
ls: cannot access 'MISSING_FILE': No such file or directory
```

### 3. Pipe (`|`)

Uses the output of one command as input for another:

```bash
ls | grep .txt
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- **`systemctl`** is the main tool for managing services.
- **Use `journalctl`** to troubleshoot failing services.
- **Processes can be killed with `kill`, `pkill`, `killall`, and `SIGKILL`.**
- **Use `Ctrl + Z` to suspend a process and `bg`/`fg` to resume.**
- **Use `;`, `&&`, and `|` for command execution control.**

Mastering these commands will help you effectively manage Linux services and processes!
