# **Network Services**

When working with Linux, managing various network services is essential. Proficiency in handling these services is crucial for several reasons. Network services are designed to perform specific tasks, many of which enable remote operations. It is important to have the knowledge and skills to communicate with other computers over the network, establish connections, transfer files, analyze network traffic, and configure these services effectively. This expertise allows us to identify potential vulnerabilities during penetration testing. Additionally, understanding the configuration options of each service enhances our overall comprehension of network security.

Consider a scenario where we are conducting a penetration test and encounter a Linux host being assessed for vulnerabilities. By monitoring network traffic, we observe that a user on this Linux host is connecting to another server via an unencrypted FTP server. Consequently, we are able to capture the user's credentials in plain text. This situation would be much less likely if the user were aware that FTP does not encrypt connections or the data transmitted. For a Linux administrator, this represents a critical oversight, as it not only exposes security weaknesses within the network but also reflects poorly on the administrators responsible for maintaining the network's security.

While it is not feasible to cover every network service, we will focus on the most important ones. This approach is beneficial not only for administrators and users but also for penetration testers who need to understand the interactions between different hosts and their own systems.

## **SSH**

Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network. It is widely used to securely manage remote systems and securely access remote systems to execute commands or transfer files. In order to connect to our or a remote Linux host via SSH, a corresponding SSH server must be available and running.

The most commonly used SSH server is the **OpenSSH server**. OpenSSH is a free and open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network.

Administrators use OpenSSH to securely manage remote systems by establishing an encrypted connection to a remote host. With OpenSSH, administrators can execute commands on remote systems, securely transfer files, and establish a secure remote connection without the transmission of data and commands being intercepted by third parties.

### **Install OpenSSH**

```bash
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

To check if the server is running, we can use the following command:

### **Server Status**

```bash
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ systemctl status ssh
```

```

             └─7740 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups
```

As penetration testers, we use OpenSSH to securely access remote systems when performing a network audit. To do this, we can use the following command:

### **SSH - Logging In**

```bash
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ ssh cry0l1t3@10.129.17.122
```

```
The authenticity of host '10.129.17.122 (10.129.17.122)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:bKzhv+n2pYqr2r...Egf8LfqaHNxk.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Warning: Permanently added '10.129.17.122' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

cry0l1t3@10.129.17.122's password: ***********
```

OpenSSH can be configured and customized by editing the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with a text editor. Here we can adjust settings such as the maximum number of concurrent connections, the use of passwords or keys for logins, host key checking, and more. However, it is important for us to note that changes to the OpenSSH configuration file must be done carefully.

For example, we can use SSH to securely log in to a remote system and execute commands or use tunneling and port forwarding to tunnel data over an encrypted connection to verify network settings and other system settings without the possibility of third parties intercepting the transmission of data and commands.

## **NFS**

Network File System (NFS) is a network protocol that allows us to store and manage files on remote systems as if they were stored on the local system. It enables easy and efficient management of files across networks. For example, administrators use NFS to store and manage files centrally (for Linux and Windows systems) to enable easy collaboration and management of data. For Linux, there are several NFS servers, including **NFS-UTILS (Ubuntu), NFS-Ganesha (Solaris), and OpenNFS (Red Hat Linux).**

It can also be used to share and manage resources efficiently, e.g., to replicate file systems between servers. It also offers features such as access controls, real-time file transfer, and support for multiple users accessing data simultaneously. We can use this service just like FTP in case there is no FTP client installed on the target system, or NFS is running instead of FTP.

### **Install NFS**

```bash
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y
```

To check if the server is running, we can use the following command:

### **Server Status**

```bash
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
```

```

**Permissions Table**

| **Permissions**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`             | Gives users and systems read and write permissions to the shared directory.                                                                               |
| `ro`             | Gives users and systems read-only access to the shared directory.                                                                                         |
| `no_root_squash` | Prevents the root user on the client from being restricted to the rights of a normal user.                                                                |
| `root_squash`    | Restricts the rights of the root user on the client to the rights of a normal user.                                                                       |
| `sync`           | Synchronizes the transfer of data to ensure that changes are only transferred after they have been saved on the file system.                              |
| `async`          | Transfers data asynchronously, which makes the transfer faster but may cause inconsistencies in the file system if changes have not been fully committed. |

## **Creating an NFS Share**

To create an NFS share, follow these steps:

```bash
mkdir nfs_sharing
echo '/home/cry0l1t3/nfs_sharing hostname(rw,sync,no_root_squash)' >> /etc/exports
cat /etc/exports | grep -v "#"
```

The output should be:

```
/home/cry0l1t3/nfs_sharing hostname(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
```

## **Mounting an NFS Share**

To work with the NFS share on a target system, it needs to be mounted first:

```bash
mkdir ~/target_nfs
mount 10.129.12.17:/home/john/dev_scripts ~/target_nfs
tree ~/target_nfs
```

After mounting, the contents of the target NFS share will be visible:

```
target_nfs/
├── css.css
├── html.html
├── javascript.js
├── php.php
└── xml.xml

0 directories, 5 files
```

By mounting the NFS share from the target system (10.129.12.17) to a local directory (`target_nfs`), we can interact with the files as if we were on the target system. In specific cases, NFS can also be exploited for privilege escalation.

# **Web Server**

## **Introduction to Web Servers**

A web server delivers data, documents, and applications over the internet using the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. It transmits data to clients (e.g., web browsers) and processes requests dynamically to create web pages.

Some of the most widely used web servers on Linux include:

- **Apache** (most popular, compatible with Ubuntu, Solaris, Red Hat Linux)
- **Nginx**
- **Lighttpd**
- **Caddy**

### **Use Cases for Penetration Testers**

Web servers provide various functionalities for penetration testers:

- **File Transfer** – Allow logging in and interacting with target systems through HTTP/HTTPS ports.
- **Phishing Attacks** – Host replicas of target pages to capture credentials.
- **Exploitation** – Test and exploit vulnerabilities within a network.

## **Installing Apache Web Server**

To install Apache on a Linux system:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

## **Apache Configuration**

The global settings for Apache are located in:

```plaintext
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

A key configuration block:

```xml
<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

### **Key Directives**

- **Options Indexes FollowSymLinks** – Allows directory indexing and symbolic links.
- **AllowOverride All** – Allows configuration overrides via `.htaccess`.
- **Require all granted** – Grants access to all users.

To transfer files using a web server, place them in `/var/www/html` and use `wget`, `curl`, or a browser to download them on the target system.

## **Using `.htaccess` for Directory-Level Configuration**

Instead of modifying the Apache configuration file, `.htaccess` can be used to set:

- Access controls
- URL rewriting (`mod_rewrite`)
- Security settings (`mod_security`, `mod_ssl`)

# **Python Web Server**

An alternative to Apache is the **Python Web Server**, which provides a quick way to serve files.

## **Installing Python Web Server**

```bash
sudo apt install python3 -y
python3 -m http.server
```

By default, this starts a server on **TCP/8000** and serves files from the current directory.

## **Serving a Specific Directory**

```bash
python3 -m http.server --directory /home/cry0l1t3/target_files
```

This hosts `/home/cry0l1t3/target_files` on port **8000**, allowing access via a browser or command-line tools.

## **Changing the Port**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 443
```

This runs the Python web server on **port 443** instead of 8000.

# **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

## **Overview**

A VPN acts as a **secure tunnel**, encrypting traffic between the client and server. It allows access to remote networks as if the user were physically present.

### **Common Uses**

- **Secure remote access** – Employees can connect to internal networks.
- **Privacy & anonymity** – Encrypts traffic and prevents tracking.

### **Popular VPN Solutions on Linux**

- **OpenVPN** (most popular, open-source)
- **L2TP/IPsec**
- **PPTP**
- **SSTP**
- **SoftEther**

## **Installing OpenVPN**

To install OpenVPN:

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```

## **Configuring OpenVPN**

Settings are located in:

```plaintext
/etc/openvpn/server.conf
```

This file can be modified for:

- Encryption
- Tunneling
- Traffic shaping

## **Connecting to an OpenVPN Server**

If an `.ovpn` configuration file is provided:

```bash
sudo openvpn --config internal.ovpn
```

Once connected, internal hosts can be accessed securely.
