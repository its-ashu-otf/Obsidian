**Network Services**

When working with Linux, managing various network services is essential. Proficiency in handling these services is crucial for several reasons. Network services are designed to perform specific tasks, many of which enable remote operations. It is important to have the knowledge and skills to communicate with other computers over the network, establish connections, transfer files, analyze network traffic, and configure these services effectively. This expertise allows us to identify potential vulnerabilities during penetration testing. Additionally, understanding the configuration options of each service enhances our overall comprehension of network security.

Consider a scenario where we are conducting a penetration test and encounter a Linux host being assessed for vulnerabilities. By monitoring network traffic, we observe that a user on this Linux host is connecting to another server via an unencrypted FTP server. Consequently, we are able to capture the user's credentials in plain text. This situation would be much less likely if the user were aware that FTP does not encrypt connections or the data transmitted. For a Linux administrator, this represents a critical oversight, as it not only exposes security weaknesses within the network but also reflects poorly on the administrators responsible for maintaining the network's security.

While it is not feasible to cover every network service, we will focus on the most important ones. This approach is beneficial not only for administrators and users but also for penetration testers who need to understand the interactions between different hosts and their own systems.

### **SSH**

Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network. It is widely used to securely manage remote systems and securely access remote systems to execute commands or transfer files. In order to connect to our or a remote Linux host via SSH, a corresponding SSH server must be available and running.

The most commonly used SSH server is the OpenSSH server. OpenSSH is a free and open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network.

Administrators use OpenSSH to securely manage remote systems by establishing an encrypted connection to a remote host. With OpenSSH, administrators can execute commands on remote systems, securely transfer files, and establish a secure remote connection without the transmission of data and commands being intercepted by third parties.

#### **Install OpenSSH**

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

To check if the server is running, we can use the following command:

#### **Server Status**

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

To securely access a remote system when performing a network audit, we use:

#### **SSH - Logging In**

```bash
ssh username@remote_ip_address
```

OpenSSH can be configured and customized by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.

### **NFS (Network File System)**

Network File System (NFS) is a network protocol that allows us to store and manage files on remote systems as if they were stored on the local system. It enables easy and efficient management of files across networks. Administrators use NFS to store and manage files centrally (for Linux and Windows systems) to enable easy collaboration and management of data.

#### **Install NFS**

```bash
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y
```

To check if the server is running:

#### **Server Status**

```bash
systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
```

NFS configuration is managed via the `/etc/exports` file, specifying directories to be shared and access rights.

### **Web Server**

Web servers are integral to web applications and frequently serve as primary targets during security assessments. A web server is software that delivers data, documents, applications, and various functions over the Internet.

Among the most widely used web servers on Linux platforms are Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, and Caddy. Apache is particularly popular due to its broad compatibility.

#### **Install Apache Web Server**

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

Apache configuration is managed in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`. A sample configuration looks like this:

```txt
<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

For quick file transfers, Python's built-in web server can also be used:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

To change the directory or port:

```bash
python3 -m http.server --directory /path/to/files 443
```

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

A VPN functions as a secure tunnel that connects us to another network, allowing seamless and protected access as if we were physically present within it. Organizations primarily utilize VPNs to grant their employees secure access to the internal network.

Among the most widely used VPN solutions for Linux servers are OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, PPTP, SSTP, and SoftEther. OpenVPN is a popular open-source option compatible with various operating systems.

#### **Install OpenVPN**

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```

To connect to an OpenVPN server, we use an `.ovpn` configuration file:

```bash
sudo openvpn --config internal.ovpn
```

Once connected, we can communicate with internal hosts on the network.
