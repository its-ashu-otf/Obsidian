## History 
The history of Linux begins with the release of Unix in 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T. Later, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) emerged in 1977, but legal issues with AT&T limited its development. In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU project to create a free Unix-like operating system, leading to the creation of the GNU General Public License (GPL). However, no free, widely adopted kernel existed until Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel in 1991 as a personal project.

The Linux kernel has since grown significantly, with over 23 million lines of source code, and is licensed under the GPL v2. Today, Linux powers over 600 distributions, including popular ones like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Red Hat. It is widely recognized for its security, stability, performance, and frequent updates, though it can be challenging for beginners and has fewer hardware drivers than Windows.

Linux’s open-source nature allows anyone to modify and distribute it for various purposes. It is used in servers, desktops, embedded systems, and even Android, making it the most widely installed OS globally. 

## Philosophy
| **Principle**                                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Everything is a file`                                        | All configuration files for services and components in Linux are stored as one or more text files, making management and modification straightforward. |
| `Small, single-purpose programs`                              | Linux provides a variety of tools, each designed for a specific purpose. These can be combined for flexibility and efficiency.                         |
| `Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks` | Tools can be integrated to perform large and intricate tasks, such as filtering or processing specific data.                                           |
| `Avoid captive user interfaces`                               | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.                         |
| `Configuration data stored in a text file`                    | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                  |
