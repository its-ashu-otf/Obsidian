There are several ways to edit a file. One of the most common text editors for this is `Vi` and `Vim`. More rarely, there is the `Nano` editor. We will first deal with the Nano editor here, as it is a bit easier to understand. We can create a new file directly with the Nano editor by specifying the file's name directly as the first parameter. In this case, we create a new file named `notes.txt`.

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ nano notes.txt
```

Now we should see a so-called "`pager`" open, and we can freely enter or insert any text. Our shell should then look something like this.

#### Nano Editor

```powershell
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here we can type everything we want and make our notes.▓


^G Get Help    ^O Write Out   ^W Where Is    ^K Cut Text    ^J Justify     ^C Cur Pos     M-U Undo
^X Exit        ^R Read File   ^\ Replace     ^U Uncut Text  ^T To Spell    ^_ Go To Line  M-E Redo
```

## Shortcuts of Nano Text Editor

Nano text editor “commands” are commonly referred to as “shortcuts” such as read file, save file, close file etc. The most common commands are placed at the bottom of the screen, but there are many more. Note that, nano text editor does not use the Shiftkey. All shortcuts use lowercase letters and unmodified number keys.

To see a list of valid shortcuts hit**Ctrl+G** (in your Keyboard), the output should be like this –

When you’re done looking at shortcuts, hit the**CTRL+X** to exit the help window.

Suppose, if you’re working on a new text file and you want to save it, then call it as “writing out”(Ctrl+O). The output window should be like this –

- To move the cursor forward or backward, you can hit **Ctrl+F** and**Ctrl+B**  respectively.
- To move up and down one line at a time, then you can hit **Ctrl+P** and**Ctrl+N**. In other words, you can use Right, Left, Up, and Down arrow keys (in your keyboard) respectively.
- If you want to mark any text hit **CTRL+^** shortcut key.

The output window should be like this-
