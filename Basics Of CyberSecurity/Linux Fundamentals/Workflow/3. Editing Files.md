There are several ways to edit a file. One of the most common text editors for this is `Vi` and `Vim`. More rarely, there is the `Nano` editor. We will first deal with the Nano editor here, as it is a bit easier to understand. We can create a new file directly with the Nano editor by specifying the file's name directly as the first parameter. In this case, we create a new file named `notes.txt`.

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ nano notes.txt
```

Now we should see a so-called "`pager`" open, and we can freely enter or insert any text. Our shell should then look something like this.

#### Nano Editor

```powershell
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here we can type everything we want and make our notes.▓

## Shortcuts of Nano Text Editor

Nano text editor “commands” are commonly referred to as “shortcuts” such as read file, save file, close file etc. The most common commands are placed at the bottom of the screen, but there are many more. Note that, nano text editor does not use the Shiftkey. All shortcuts use lowercase letters and unmodified number keys.

To see a list of valid shortcuts hit**Ctrl+G** (in your Keyboard), the output should be like this –
