In **Windows**, most people use tools like File Explorer to find and edit files. It's more visual, so you click around to get things done.

In **Linux**, the terminal is a powerful tool. You can type a few commands to find, edit, or even modify many files at once—without opening a separate program like Notepad or Word. For example:

- You can search for text in files (`grep`).
- Change parts of a file quickly (`sed`).
- Or combine commands to process tons of files in seconds.

The terminal is faster and more efficient, especially for repetitive tasks or working with lots of files. In Windows, tools like PowerShell  or Command Prompt can give you similar features, but Linux is naturally built for this style of work.

## Create, Move, and Copy

Next, let us work with files and directories and learn how to create, rename, move, copy, and delete. First, let us create an empty file and a directory. We can use `touch` to create an empty file and `mkdir` to create a directory.

The syntax for this is the following:

#### Syntax - touch

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>
```
