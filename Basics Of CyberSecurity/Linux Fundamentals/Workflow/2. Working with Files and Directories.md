In **Windows**, most people use tools like File Explorer to find and edit files. It's more visual, so you click around to get things done.

In **Linux**, the terminal is a powerful tool. You can type a few commands to find, edit, or even modify many files at once—without opening a separate program like Notepad or Word. For example:

- You can search for text in files (`grep`).
- Change parts of a file quickly (`sed`).
- Or combine commands to process tons of files in seconds.

The terminal is faster and more efficient, especially for repetitive tasks or working with lots of files. In Windows, tools like PowerShell  or Command Prompt can give you similar features, but Linux is naturally built for this style of work.

## Create, Move, and Copy

Next, let us work with files and directories and learn how to create, rename, move, copy, and delete. First, let us create an empty file and a directory. We can use `touch` to create an empty file and `mkdir` to create a directory.

The syntax for this is the following:

#### Syntax - touch

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>
```

#### Syntax - mkdir

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ mkdir <name>
```

In this example, we name the file `info.txt` and the directory `Storage`. To create these, we follow the commands and their syntax shown above.

#### Create an Empty File

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ touch info.txt
```

#### Create a Directory

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ mkdir Storage
```

We may want to have specific directories in the directory, and it would be very time-consuming to create this command for every single directory. The command `mkdir` has an option marked `-p` to add parent directories.

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents
```

We can look at the whole structure after creating the parent directories with the tool `tree`.

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
├── info.txt
└── Storage
    └── local
        └── user
            └── documents

4 directories, 1 file
```

We can also create files directly in the directories by specifying the path where the file should be stored. The trick is to use the single dot (`.`) to tell the system that we want to start from the current directory. So the command for creating another empty file looks like this:

#### Create userinfo.txt

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ touch ./Storage/local/user/userinfo.txt
```

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
├── info.txt
└── Storage
    └── local
        └── user
            ├── documents
            └── userinfo.txt

4 directories, 2 files
```

With the command `mv`, we can move and also rename files and directories. The syntax for this looks like this:

#### Syntax - mv

```powershell
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>
```

First, let us rename the file `info.txt` to `information.txt` and then move it to the directory `Storage`.

```shell-session
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ mv info.txt information.txt
```
