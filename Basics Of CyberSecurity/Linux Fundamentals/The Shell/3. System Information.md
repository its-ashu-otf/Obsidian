Since we will be working with many different Linux systems, we need to learn the structure and the information about the system, its processes, network configurations, users, directories, user settings, and the corresponding parameters. Here is a list of the necessary tools that will help us get the above information. Most of them are installed by default.

| **Command** | **Description**                                                                                                                    |

Let us look at a few examples.

#### Hostname

The `hostname` command is pretty self-explanatory and will just print the name of the computer that we are logged into

```shell-session
itsashuotf@htb[/htb]$ hostname

nixfund
```

#### Whoami

This quick and easy command can be used on both Windows and Linux systems to get our current username. During a security assessment, we obtain reverse shell access on a host, and one of the first bits of situational awareness we should do is figuring out what user we are running as. From there, we can figure out if the user has any special privileges/access.
