# Remote Desktop Protocols

Remote desktop protocols enable graphical remote access to systems, allowing administrators to manage, troubleshoot, and update machines remotely. The choice of protocol depends on the operating system being accessed.

## Common Remote Desktop Protocols

### **1. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

- Used primarily in Windows environments.
- Allows administrators to remotely access and interact with a Windows desktop.

### **2. Virtual Network Computing (VNC)**

- Commonly used in Linux environments but also cross-platform.
- Provides graphical access to remote desktops similarly to RDP.

**Analogy:** Think of remote desktop protocols like keys to different buildings. RDP is a key designed for Windows buildings, while VNC is a universal key that works across multiple platforms.

## XServer & X11 Protocol

### **XServer Overview**

- XServer is the user-side component of the **X Window System (X11)**.
- X11 enables applications to open windows on a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Primarily used in **Unix/Linux** systems but available for other OSs.

### **How XServer Works**

- The GUI communicates with the OS through an **X server**.
- Uses **TCP/IP** or **Unix sockets** for communication.
- Default ports: **6000-6009** (e.g., display `:0` corresponds to port `6000`).
- Supports **network transparency**, allowing remote access to applications without additional protocols like VNC or RDP.
- Unlike RDP and VNC (which transmit a rendered graphical output), **X11 renders the display locally**, reducing network traffic.

### **Security Concerns with X11**

- **Unencrypted communication** poses security risks.
- Attackers can capture X server contents without traditional network sniffing.
- Vulnerabilities like **CVE-2017-2624, CVE-2017-2625, and CVE-2017-2626** have allowed unauthorized access to X sessions.

### **Securing X11 with SSH Tunneling**

- X11 forwarding should be enabled in **`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`**:
    
    ```bash
    X11Forwarding yes
    ```
    
- To launch a remote application securely:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -X user@remote_host /usr/bin/firefox
    ```

## XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol)

- **Used for managing remote X sessions over UDP port 177.**
- Enables **full GUI redirection** (e.g., KDE or GNOME) to a client machine.
- **Security risk**: Vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle attacks**, allowing unauthorized access.

## Virtual Network Computing (VNC)

- Based on the **Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol**.
- Enables **remote desktop sharing and control**.
- Requires authentication and supports encryption.
- Often used for IT support, troubleshooting, and remote workstation access.

### **VNC Server Types**

1. **Standard VNC Server** - Shares the actual screen of the remote machine.
2. **Virtual Session VNC Server** - Creates independent virtual desktops.

### **VNC Ports**

- Default **TCP port 5900** (for display `:0`).
- Additional displays: **5901, 5902, etc.**

### **Popular VNC Implementations**

- **TigerVNC**
- **TightVNC**
- **RealVNC**
- **UltraVNC** (known for encryption & security features)

### **Setting Up a TigerVNC Server**

1. Install necessary packages:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tigervnc-standalone-server -y
    ```
    
2. Set a password for VNC:
    
    ```bash
    vncpasswd
    ```
    
3. Create necessary configuration files:
    
    ```bash
    touch ~/.vnc/xstartup ~/.vnc/config
    ```
    
4. Configure session startup (**`~/.vnc/xstartup`**):
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    unset SESSION_MANAGER
    unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    /usr/bin/startxfce4
    [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
    [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
    x-window-manager &
    ```
    
5. Define VNC server settings (**`~/.vnc/config`**):
    
    ```bash
    geometry=1920x1080
    dpi=96
    ```
    
6. Grant execution permissions:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
    ```
    
7. Start the VNC server:
    
    ```bash
    vncserver
    ```
    
8. Check active VNC sessions:
    
    ```bash
    vncserver -list
    ```
    
    **Example Output:**
    
    ```
    X DISPLAY #     RFB PORT #      PROCESS ID
    :1              5901            79746
    ```
    

## Securing VNC with SSH Tunneling

To encrypt the connection, create an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -N -f -l user remote_host
```

### **Connecting to the VNC Server via SSH Tunnel**

```bash
xtightvncviewer localhost:5901
```

### **Authentication Process**

```bash
Connected to RFB server, using protocol version 3.8
Performing standard VNC authentication
Password: ******
Authentication successful
```
