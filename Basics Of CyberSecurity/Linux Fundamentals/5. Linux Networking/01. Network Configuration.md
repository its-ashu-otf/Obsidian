## Importance of Network Configuration in Penetration Testing

As a penetration tester, mastering network configuration in Linux is essential for setting up testing environments, manipulating network traffic, and identifying vulnerabilities. A solid understanding of Linux network configuration allows testers to optimize their procedures and results effectively.

## Managing Network Interfaces

Managing network interfaces involves:

- Assigning IP addresses
- Configuring network devices such as routers and switches
- Setting up various network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, FTP)
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues for wired and wireless networks

### Network Access Control (NAC)

NAC enhances network security by restricting unauthorized access. The main NAC models are:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**|The owner sets permissions for resource access.|
|**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**|The operating system enforces permissions, increasing security but reducing flexibility.|
|**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**|Permissions are assigned based on organizational roles, simplifying privilege management.|

Configuring Linux network devices for NAC involves:

- Setting up **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) and **AppArmor** profiles
- Using **TCP wrappers** to control access to services based on IP addresses

## Network Monitoring and Analysis Tools

Monitoring network traffic helps detect anomalies and security breaches. Key tools include:

- **syslog / rsyslog** – Logs network events
- **ss** – Displays socket statistics
- **lsof** – Lists open files
- **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – Analyzes and visualizes logs

## Configuring Network Interfaces in Linux

### Viewing Network Interfaces

Use the following commands to check the status of network interfaces:

```bash
ifconfig
ip addr
```

Example output:

```bash
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 178.62.32.126  netmask 255.255.192.0  broadcast 178.62.63.255
        ...
```

### Activating Network Interfaces

To bring up an interface (e.g., `eth0`):

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 up  # OR
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

### Assigning an IP Address to an Interface

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
```

### Setting a Netmask for an Interface

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

### Assigning a Default Gateway

```bash
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0
```

## Configuring DNS Settings

DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses. To configure DNS, edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

> **Note:** Changes to `/etc/resolv.conf` are not persistent across reboots. To make them permanent, use appropriate network management tools.

## Making Network Configuration Persistent

Network settings should be saved to persist across reboots. Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
```

Example configuration:

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.1.1
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

## Restarting the Networking Service

To apply changes, restart the networking service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

# **Network Access Control (NAC)**

Network Access Control (NAC) is a crucial component of **network security**, especially in today's era of increasing **cyber threats**. As a **penetration tester**, understanding NAC is essential for evaluating and testing network security measures effectively.

NAC ensures that only **authorized and compliant devices** gain access to the network, preventing **unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats**. Organizations implement NAC to protect their assets and data from **cybercriminals** who continuously seek to exploit **system vulnerabilities**.

## **NAC Technologies**

The following NAC technologies help enhance security measures:

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Each of these provides different levels of **access control and security**. Understanding their specific **use cases** is vital for penetration testers when evaluating network security.

### **1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

- **Allows resource owners** to control access permissions to their resources.
- Users and groups can **grant or restrict access** to files and applications.
- Permissions can be set for **reading, writing, executing, or deleting resources**.
- **Widely used** but susceptible to security risks if misconfigured.

### **2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

- Provides **more granular control** than DAC.
- Access is determined by **security labels** assigned to both **resources and users/processes**.
- **Highly secure** and used in **military, financial, and healthcare systems**.
- Prevents **unauthorized access** and minimizes the impact of **security breaches**.

### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Assigns permissions based on **user roles within an organization**.
- Users are granted access based on **job responsibilities**.
- **Simplifies management** and reduces risk of **errors and security breaches**.
- Commonly used in **large organizations, government agencies, and financial institutions**.

---

## **Monitoring**

**Network monitoring** involves **capturing, analyzing, and interpreting network traffic** to detect **security threats, performance issues, and suspicious activities**.

- Penetration testers can capture **unencrypted credentials** (e.g., FTP login attempts).
- Helps identify **suspicious activity, malicious traffic, and vulnerabilities**.
- **Common network monitoring tools:**
    - **Wireshark**
    - **tshark**
    - **Tcpdump**

---

## **Troubleshooting**

Network troubleshooting involves **diagnosing and resolving network issues** to ensure optimal performance. **Common network problems include:**

- **Connectivity issues**
- **DNS resolution failures**
- **Packet loss**
- **Performance bottlenecks**

**Common troubleshooting tools:**

- **Ping** – Tests connectivity between two devices.
- **Traceroute** – Traces packet routes to a remote host.
- **Netstat** – Displays active network connections.
- **Nmap** – Scans for open ports and network vulnerabilities.

### **Example Commands:**

#### **Ping Command**

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

#### **Traceroute Command**

```bash
traceroute www.inlanefreight.com
```

#### **Netstat Command**

```bash
netstat -a
```

## **Hardening**

### **Key Security Mechanisms for Linux Systems:**

- **Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)**
- **AppArmor**
- **TCP Wrappers**

### **1. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**

- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system** integrated into the **Linux kernel**.
- Enforces **security policies** to control **system and application access**.
- **Highly secure but complex** to configure.

### **2. AppArmor**

- Also a **MAC system** but **simpler and more user-friendly**.
- Uses **application profiles** to define access permissions.
- Easier to manage than SELinux but offers **less granularity**.

### **3. TCP Wrappers**

- **Host-based access control tool**.
- Restricts access based on **incoming connection IP addresses**.
- Useful for **basic network-level protection**.

## **Setup and Configuration Tasks**

### **SELinux Configuration Tasks:**

1. **Install SELinux** on your VM.
2. Configure SELinux to **prevent a user from accessing a specific file**.
3. Configure SELinux to **allow a single user access to a specific network service while denying all others**.
4. Configure SELinux to **deny access to a specific user or group for a network service**.

### **AppArmor Configuration Tasks:**

1. Configure AppArmor to **prevent a user from accessing a specific file**.
2. Configure AppArmor to **allow a single user to access a network service while denying all others**.
3. Configure AppArmor to **deny access to a specific user or group for a network service**.

### **TCP Wrappers Configuration Tasks:**

1. Configure TCP Wrappers to **allow access to a specific network service from a specific IP address**.
2. Configure TCP Wrappers to **deny access to a specific network service from a specific IP address**.
3. Configure TCP Wrappers to **allow access to a specific network service from a range of IP addresses**.
