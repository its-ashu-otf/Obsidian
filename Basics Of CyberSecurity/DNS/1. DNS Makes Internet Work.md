## What is DNS? (The Contacts app of the Internet)
A DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phonebook for the internet. It helps you find websites and online services by matching their human-readable domain names to their numerical IP addresses.

Think of it this way: when you want to visit a website, you typically type in its domain name (like "www.example.com") rather than its IP address (a series of numbers like "93.184.216.34"). The DNS system translates that domain name into the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the correct server and display the website.

 DNS translates domain names to [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

For example:

* You type in "www.google.com" in your browser.
* The DNS system looks up the IP address associated with "www.google.com".
* It finds the IP address "173.194.222.104" and returns it to your browser.
* Your browser uses that IP address to connect to Google's servers, and you see the website.

Without a DNS system, you'd need to know the exact IP address of every website you want to visit, which would be very cumbersome! The DNS makes it easy for humans to access websites using simple domain names.

## DNS Hierarchy: The Mafia Bosses of the Internet
The **DNS Hierarchy** is a hierarchical structure that organizes the Domain Name System (DNS) into layers, making it easier to manage and resolve domain names.

Here's an overview of the DNS Hierarchy:

1. **Root Zone**: The top-most level of the DNS hierarchy is the Root Zone, which contains all the top-level domains (TLDs). Think of it as a huge library with books labelled by TLDs (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
2. **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: The second level down from the Root Zone are the TLDs. These are broad categories that group domains together (e.g., .com, .org, .edu). Each TLD has its own set of servers and records.
3. **Second-Level Domains**: Under each TLD is a layer of second-level domains (SLDs), which are further sub-divided into third-level domains (TLDs). For example:
	* .com
	* .org
	* .net

These SLDs can be thought of as "sub-libraries" within the main library (Root Zone).

4. **Authoritative Name Servers**: The final level of the DNS hierarchy is the Authoritative Name Server, which contains the actual records for a specific domain name (e.g., example.com). These servers are responsible for hosting and resolving domain names.

Here's an example to illustrate the DNS Hierarchy:

* Root Zone: `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
	+ .com
		- example.com (Authoritative Name Server)
			- ip-address (actual record)

In this example, when you enter `example.com` in your web browser, here's how it gets resolved through the DNS Hierarchy:

1. The stub resolver sends a query to the DNS Recursor.
2. The DNS Recursor contacts the Root Zone and asks for the TLD Server responsible for `.com`.
3. The Root Zone directs the DNS Recursor to the .com TLD Server.
4. The .com TLD Server points the DNS Recursor to the Authoritative Name Server for `example.com`.
5. The Authoritative Name Server returns the actual record (IP address) associated with `example.com`.

The DNS Hierarchy makes it possible to manage a vast number of domain names and provide efficient resolution services.

Here's a simple diagram to visualize the DNS Hierarchy:
```
 Root Zone
  |
  |--- .com TLD Server
  |       |
  |       |--- example.com Authoritative Name Server
  |       |       |
  |       |       |--- ip-address (actual record)
```
This is a simplified representation, but it should give you an idea of how the DNS Hierarchy works!
