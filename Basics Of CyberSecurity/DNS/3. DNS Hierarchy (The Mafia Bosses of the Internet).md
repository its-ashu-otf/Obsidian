The **DNS Hierarchy** is a hierarchical structure that organizes the Domain Name System (DNS) into layers, making it easier to manage and resolve domain names.

Here's an overview of the DNS Hierarchy:

1. **Root Zone**: The top-most level of the DNS hierarchy is the Root Zone, which contains all the top-level domains (TLDs). Think of it as a huge library with books labelled by TLDs (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
2. **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: The second level down from the Root Zone are the TLDs. These are broad categories that group domains together (e.g., .com, .org, .edu). Each TLD has its own set of servers and records.
3. **Second-Level Domains**: Under each TLD is a layer of second-level domains (SLDs), which are further sub-divided into third-level domains (TLDs). For example:
	* .com
	* .org
	* .net

These SLDs can be thought of as "sub-libraries" within the main library (Root Zone).

4. **Authoritative Name Servers**: The final level of the DNS hierarchy is the Authoritative Name Server, which contains the actual records for a specific domain name (e.g., example.com). These servers are responsible for hosting and resolving domain names.

Here's an example to illustrate the DNS Hierarchy:

* Root Zone: `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
	+ .com
		- example.com (Authoritative Name Server)
			- ip-address (actual record)

In this example, when you enter `example.com` in your web browser, here's how it gets resolved through the DNS Hierarchy:

1. The stub resolver sends a query to the DNS Recursor.
2. The DNS Recursor contacts the Root Zone and asks for the TLD Server responsible for `.com`.
3. The Root Zone directs the DNS Recursor to the .com TLD Server.
4. The .com TLD Server points the DNS Recursor to the Authoritative Name Server for `example.com`.
5. The Authoritative Name Server returns the actual record (IP address) associated with `example.com`.

The DNS Hierarchy makes it possible to manage a vast number of domain names and provide efficient resolution services.

Here's a simple diagram to visualize the DNS Hierarchy:
```
 Root Zone
  |
  |--- .com TLD Server
  |       |
  |       |--- example.com Authoritative Name Server
  |       |       |
  |       |       |--- ip-address (actual record)
```
This is a simplified representation, but it should give you an idea of how the DNS Hierarchy works!

## Root Servers

The authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone, commonly known as the “root servers”, are a network of hundreds of servers in many countries around the world. They are configured in the DNS root zone as 13 named authorities, as follows.

## Configuring the Root Servers

Operators who manage a DNS recursive resolver typically need to configure a _“root hints file”_. This file contains the names and IP addresses of the root servers, so the software can bootstrap the DNS resolution process. For many pieces of software, this list comes built into the software.

### Talking to ROOT Servers

```bash
nslookup -type=NS <domain name> <hostname>

for eg:
nslookup -type=NS google.com a.root-servers.net
```
