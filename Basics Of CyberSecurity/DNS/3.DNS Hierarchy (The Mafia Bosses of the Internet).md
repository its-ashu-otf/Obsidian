## Root Servers

The authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone, commonly known as the “root servers”, are a network of hundreds of servers in many countries around the world. They are configured in the DNS root zone as 13 named authorities, as follows.

## Configuring the Root Servers

Operators who manage a DNS recursive resolver typically need to configure a _“root hints file”_. This file contains the names and IP addresses of the root servers, so the software can bootstrap the DNS resolution process. For many pieces of software, this list comes built into the software.

### Talking to ROOT Servers

```bash
nslookup -type=NS <domain name> <hostname>

for eg:
nslookup -type=NS google.com a.root-servers.net
```
