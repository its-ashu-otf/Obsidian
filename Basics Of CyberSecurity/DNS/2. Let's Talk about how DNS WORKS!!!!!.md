### Stub Resolver
A stub resolver is a small program that acts as an intermediary between your application (or the operating system) and the Domain Name System (DNS).


When you ask for a domain name (like "example.com") to be resolved into its IP address, your application sends this request to the stub resolver. The stub resolver then takes care of sending the request to a DNS server, getting the answer back, and providing it to your application.

> [!NOTE] NOTE:
> The **stub resolver** is actually a component that's part of the client machine (like your computer or phone).

Think of the stub resolver as a messenger:

1. Your application says: "Hey, I need the IP address for example.com."
2. The stub resolver says: "Okay, I'll take care of that." (sends a request to the DNS server)
3. The DNS server responds with the answer.
4. The stub resolver says: "Here's the result!" (gives the answer back to your application)

The term "stub" implies that this is a minimal program that just performs this specific function - it doesn't have any other features or capabilities.

In modern operating systems, the stub resolver is often provided by the system itself, so you don't usually need to think about it. However, in certain situations (like embedded systems or custom applications), you might need to implement your own stub resolver.

### How does DNS Caching Works?
Caching plays a crucial role in a stub resolver's functionality!

When the stub resolver receives a request from your application, it not only sends the query to the DNS server but also checks its cache for a recent result. If the requested domain name is already cached (i.e., the stub resolver remembers a previous answer), it will:

1. Return the cached answer directly to your application.
2. Possibly update the cache with the current answer, so that future requests can be served more quickly.

This caching mechanism improves performance by reducing the number of times the stub resolver needs to ask the DNS server for information. If the requested domain name is not in the cache (or if it's too old), the stub resolver will:

1. Send a new query to the DNS server.
2. Cache the response, so that future requests can be served quickly.

Caching helps with:

* **Reduced latency**: By serving cached results, your application gets answers more quickly.
* **Lower network traffic**: The stub resolver doesn't need to send as many queries to the DNS server, which reduces overall network usage.

However, caching also introduces some trade-offs:

* **Cache staleness**: If the stub resolver caches a result that's outdated (e.g., due to recent changes in the domain name), it might return incorrect information.
* **Cache size limitations**: As more and more domains are cached, cache size constraints may become an issue.

To mitigate these concerns, modern stub resolvers often employ techniques like:

* **Time-to-live (TTL)**: The DNS server specifies how long a result should be cached, which helps maintain freshness.
* **Least-recently-used (LRU) eviction**: When the cache is full and a new entry needs to be added, the least recently used entry might be evicted.

These caching strategies help balance performance gains with accuracy and resource management.

##  There are 4 DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:
You've described the four types of DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:

1. **DNS Recursor**: The first point of contact between the client machine and the DNS hierarchy. It receives queries from clients, like web browsers, and then recursively asks other DNS servers to resolve the query.

Think of it as a librarian who's asked to find a specific book (IP address). They'll search their own collection, but if they don't have it, they'll ask another librarian (recursive query).

2. **Root Nameserver**: The top-most level of the DNS hierarchy. It serves as an index that points to different TLDs (Top-Level Domains), which are like specific sections in a library.

Example: If you search for "example.com", the root nameserver would point you towards the ".com" TLD server.

3. **TLD Nameserver (Authoritative Server)**: The next level down from the root nameserver. It's responsible for hosting the records for a specific Top-Level Domain, like ".com".

In your example, the TLD server is "com", which means it hosts all the records related to ".com" domain names.

4. **Authoritative Nameserver**: This is the final level of the DNS hierarchy. It's responsible for hosting the actual records (IP addresses) for a specific domain name.

For example, if you search for "example.com", the authoritative nameserver for "example.com" would return the IP address associated with that domain name to the DNS recursor.

Here's an example of how this works:

* Web browser (client machine) -> asks DNS Recursor (librarian) for "example.com"
* DNS Recursor -> asks Root Nameserver (index) for ".com" TLD server
* Root Nameserver -> points to ".com" TLD Server (specific rack)
* TLD Server -> looks up and finds the Authoritative Nameserver for "example.com"
* Authoritative Nameserver -> returns IP address to DNS Recursor
* DNS Recursor -> returns IP address to web browser

This is a simplified explanation, but it should give you an idea of how these four types of DNS servers work together to resolve domain names and load websites!

#### Summary of Above

The **stub resolver** is actually a component that's part of the client machine (like your computer or phone). It's not one of the four DNS servers I mentioned earlier.

Here's how it fits into the picture:

1. Your web browser (client application) asks for a domain name, like "example.com", to be resolved.
2. The **stub resolver** on your machine receives this request and sends it to the **DNS Recursor** (the first point of contact).
3. The DNS Recursor then recursively queries other DNS servers (Root Nameserver, TLD Server, and Authoritative Nameserver) as described earlier.

In other words, the stub resolver is a "front-end" that interacts with your client application (web browser), while the DNS Recursor is the "back-end" that actually performs the recursive query to resolve the domain name.

Think of it like this:

- The stub resolver is like an API or an interface that allows your web browser to communicate with the rest of the DNS system.
- The DNS Recursor, Root Nameserver, TLD Server, and Authoritative Nameserver are all part of the underlying infrastructure that resolves domain names.

So, in summary: the stub resolver is a component on your client machine that interacts with your application (like web browser), while the four DNS servers I mentioned earlier are involved in resolving the actual domain name.

## What's the difference between an authoritative DNS server and a recursive DNS resolver?

**Authoritative DNS Server:**

![[Pasted image 20240828224153.png]]

An **authoritative DNS server**, also known as an **Authoritative Name Server**, is a DNS server that hosts and serves the actual records (IP addresses, mail servers, etc.) for a specific domain name. It's responsible for answering queries about its own zone.

Think of it like this:

* The Authoritative DNS server is like a librarian who has access to a specific book (domain record).
* When someone asks the librarian about that book, they can answer with confidence because they have the actual information stored in their catalogue.

**Recursive DNS Resolver:**

![[Pasted image 20240828224139.png]]

A **recursive DNS resolver**, also known as a **DNS Recursor**, is a DNS server that receives queries from clients and recursively asks other DNS servers to resolve the query. It caches responses for future use but doesn't host any zone data itself.

Think of it like this:

* The Recursive DNS resolver is like a librarian who has access to a vast network of libraries (other DNS servers).
* When someone asks the librarian about a specific book, they don't have the actual information stored in their catalogue.
* However, they know which library (DNS server) might have that book and can ask them on behalf of the client.

Key differences:

1. **Data ownership**: An Authoritative DNS server owns and serves the data for its own zone, while a Recursive DNS resolver does not.
2. **Query resolution**: An Authoritative DNS server is responsible for resolving queries about its own domain, whereas a Recursive DNS resolver delegates this responsibility to other DNS servers.
3. **Caching**: A Recursive DNS resolver caches responses from other DNS servers to improve performance and reduce latency.

Here's an example:

* You want to visit `example.com`. Your client (web browser) sends a query to the Recursive DNS resolver (your internet service provider's DNS server).
* The Recursive DNS resolver asks the Authoritative Name Server for `example.com` (the actual owner of that domain).
* The Authoritative Name Server responds with the IP address associated with `example.com`.
* Your client uses this IP address to connect to the `example.com` website.

In summary:

* Authoritative DNS servers host and serve their own zone data.
* Recursive DNS resolvers receive queries, delegate resolution to other DNS servers (including Authoritative Name Servers), and cache responses for future use.
