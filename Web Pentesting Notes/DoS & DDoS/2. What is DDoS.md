A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as [IoT devices](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-of-things-iot/).

From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.

## How does a DDoS attack work?

DDoS attacks are carried out with networks of Internet-connected machines.

These networks consist of computers and other devices (such as IoT devices)which have been infected with [malware](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/), allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker. These individual devices are referred to as [bots](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/) (or zombies), and a group of bots is called a [botnet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/).

Once a botnet has been established, the attacker is able to direct an attack by sending remote instructions to each bot.

When a victim’s server or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot sends requests to the target’s [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/), potentially causing the server or network to become overwhelmed, resulting in a [denial-of-service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) to normal traffic.

Because each bot is a legitimate Internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.

  

## How to identify a DDoS attack

The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes — such a legitimate spike in traffic — can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Traffic analytics tools can help you spot some of these tell-tale signs of a DDoS attack:

- Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
- A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioural profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
- An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
- Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)

There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack.
