The impact of a Local File Inclusion attack can vary based on the exploitation and the read permissions of the webserver user. Based on these factors, an attacker can gather usernames via an /etc/passwd file, harvest useful information from log files, or combine this vulnerability with other attack vectors (such as file upload vulnerability) to execute commands remotely.

Letâ€™s take a closer look at three possible outcomes of local file inclusion:

### 1. Information disclosure
Although not the worst outcome of a local file inclusion vulnerability, information disclosure can reveal important information about the application and its configuration. That information can be valuable to an attacker to gain a deeper understanding of the application and can help them detect and exploit other vulnerabilities.

### 2. Directory Traversal (Also Known as Path Traversal)
A local file inclusion vulnerability can lead to Directory Traversal attacks, where an attacker will try to find and access files on the web server to gain more useful information, such as log files. Log files can reveal the structure of the application or expose paths to sensitive files.

An incorrectly configured server can give attackers access to user config files, giving them access to other files on your server, or even gain administrator access. 

### 3. Remote Code Execution
Combined with a file upload vulnerability, a Local File vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. In this case the attacker would use LFI to execute the unwanted file.

To compound matters, an attacker can upload a file to the server to gain the ability to execute commands remotely, resulting in the attacker being able to control the whole server remotely.
