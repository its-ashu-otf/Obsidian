## File inclusion attack types:
1. **LFI or Local File Inclusion** occurs when an attacker is able to get a website to include a file that was not intended to be an option for this application. A common example is when an application uses the path to a file as input. When website or web application inputs aren’t properly sanitized, local files on a server become vulnerable to attacks. User inputs that contain paths to files and are incorrectly validated, attackers can gain access to those files and retrieve sensitive files in other directories.

	The following INFOSEC example illustrates how a local file inclusion attack can occur:

	``http://victim_site/abc.php?file=userinput.txt

	Attackers can insert a pernicious input to retrieve sensitive files within the current directory or traverse other directories to further compromise your system.

2. **RFI or Remote File Inclusion** is similar to LFI but in this case it is possible for an attacker to load a remote file on the host using protocols like HTTP, FTP etc. RFI vulnerabilities will utilize an external source, as opposed to accessing files within the local server, to execute an attack. Attackers will make use of the “dynamic file include” command to insert harmful external files or scripts. Without proper sanitation of files, attackers can take advantage of web applications to insert external files with harmful scripts.

	 Here’s an example of how an RFI vulnerability might occur: 
	 
	 ``www.victim_site.com/abc.php?testfile=example

	The vulnerable PHP code: 
	`$test = $_REQUEST[“testfile”]; Include($test.”.php”);` 
	
	The “testfile” parameter in this example is supplied by the user, and the code takes the “testfile” and inserts it into the PHP file.

	In both cases, the vulnerabilities are a direct result of poor input validations, which means one of the only ways to prevent file inclusion vulnerabilities is to maintain your sanitation practices.
