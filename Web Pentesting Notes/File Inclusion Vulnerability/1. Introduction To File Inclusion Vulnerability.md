> File inclusion vulnerabilities can be primarily found on web applications that utilize a scripting runtime. These vulnerabilities give attackers access to sensitive files on their web servers or allow them to utilize include functionality to carry out malicious files on their servers.

Dynamic websites include HTML pages on the fly using information from the HTTP request to include GET
and POST parameters, cookies, and other variables. It is common for a page to "include" another page
based on some of these parameters.

## Key takeaways
- Most file inclusion vulnerabilities are, like a lot of file-related vulnerabilities, due to weak validation processes that give access to user input without legitimate validation.
- There are two file inclusion vulnerability types that you should be aware of in preparing for an attack: Local file inclusion (LFI) and remote file inclusion (RFI).
- While file inclusion vulnerabilities are common and should be taken seriously, you can prevent attacks and minimize damage by taking a proactive security and sanitation approach.
