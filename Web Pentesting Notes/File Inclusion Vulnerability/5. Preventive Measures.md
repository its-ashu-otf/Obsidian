## File inclusion vulnerability mitigation

1. User input sanitation has to be implemented to mitigate file inclusion attacks. It’s also important, however, to remember that it’s practically impossible to sanitize all user inputs and that sanitation is just one aspect of a holistic security effort.
2. Two ways to ensure proper sanitation are 
		a) to accept file names with numbers 0-9 and letters A-Z
		b) only allow files from one directory so you can avoid directory traversals.
3. Create a whitelist when enabling remote file inclusion and ensure that you’re only in-taking files from that whitelist.
4. Make the server send download headers automatically instead of executing files in a specified directory
5. Save your file paths in a secure database and give an ID for every single one, this way users only get to see their ID without viewing or altering the path.
6. Use verified and secured whitelist files and ignore everything else.
