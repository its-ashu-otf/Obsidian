1. **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
2. **Integrity**: Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and not modified by unauthorized parties.
3. **Availability**: Making sure that data and systems are accessible when needed.
4. **Authenticity:** Ensures the message comes from a specific sender and guarantees the message is genuine and has not been altered.
5. **Non-Repudiation:** Ensures the sender cannot deny sending a message and holds the sender accountable for their actions.

The primary goal of Information Security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, as well as protecting it from cyber threats and risks.
