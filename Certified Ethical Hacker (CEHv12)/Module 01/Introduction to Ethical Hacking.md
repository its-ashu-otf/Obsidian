# Information Security Overview
**Information Security** refers to the practice of defending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction."

This definition encompasses various aspects of protecting digital assets, including the **CIA Triad** and Other Elements too:

1. **Confidentiality (C):**
    - Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
    - Ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or use sensitive data.
2. **Integrity (I):**
    - Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and not modified by unauthorized parties.
    - Preventing tampering or alteration of data during transmission or storage.
3. **Availability (A):**
    - Making sure that data and systems are accessible when needed.
    - Ensuring that authorized personnel can access necessary resources and information.
4. **Authenticity:** 
	- Ensures the message comes from a specific sender. 
	- Guarantees the message is genuine and has not been altered.   
 1. **Non-Repudiation:**
	*  Ensures the sender cannot deny sending a message.
	*  Holds the sender accountable for their actions.

The primary goal of Information Security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, as well as protecting it from cyber threats and risks.

### Attack Formula
An **attack** is defined as a combination of:
- **Motive (Goal)**: The reason for the attack, which usually arises from the attacker’s belief that the target system or data has value.
- **Method**: The technique or tool used to carry out the attack.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in the system or security policies that attackers exploit to achieve their goals.

### Motives Behind Attacks
The image lists various motives that drive attackers:
- **Disrupting Business Continuity**: Causing interruptions to a business's operations.
- **Stealing Information and Manipulating Data**: Accessing or altering sensitive data.
- **Creating Fear and Chaos by Disrupting Critical Infrastructures**: Targeting essential services (like power or transportation) to instil fear.
- **Causing Financial Loss**: Leading to direct or indirect financial harm to the target.
- **Propagating Religious or Political Beliefs**: Using attacks as a means to promote certain ideologies.
- **Achieving Military Objectives**: Conducting attacks to fulfil a nation-state’s strategic or military goals.
- **Damaging the Target's Reputation**: Tarnishing the target's public image.
- **Taking Revenge**: Personal or organizational retaliation.
- **Demanding Ransom**: Requiring payment (often through ransomware) to restore access to data or systems. 

This framework helps understand that information security attacks are usually intentional actions with specific goals, carried out by leveraging weaknesses in systems.
