The **CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)**, focusing on the stages of ethical hacking. Here's an elaboration with real-world examples:

---

### 1. **Footprinting**

**Definition**: Gathering as much information about the target as possible.

- **Examples**:
    - **DNS Footprinting**: Using tools like _nslookup_ or _dig_ to gather DNS records.
    - **Social Media Profiling**: Collecting information about a company or individual from LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
    - **Google Dorking**: Using advanced search operators to find sensitive information like login pages or exposed documents.
    - **Whois Lookup**: Identifying domain ownership and registration details.

---

### 2. **Scanning**

**Definition**: Actively probing the target to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

- **Examples**:
    - **Port Scanning**: Using tools like _Nmap_ to find open ports (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP or 3389 for RDP).
    - **Network Mapping**: Creating a topology of the network using tools like _Zenmap_ or _Netdiscover_.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scanning for vulnerabilities using _Nessus_ or _OpenVAS_.

---

### 3. **Enumeration**

**Definition**: Extracting detailed information from the target, such as user accounts or shared resources.

- **Examples**:
    - **SMB Enumeration**: Using tools like _Enum4linux_ or _Metasploit_ to list shared folders on a Windows server.
    - **SNMP Enumeration**: Extracting network configuration using SNMP tools like _snmpwalk_.
    - **Active Directory Enumeration**: Enumerating users and groups in an AD environment using tools like _BloodHound_.

---

### 4. **Vulnerability Analysis**

**Definition**: Identifying weaknesses in the system that can be exploited.

- **Examples**:
    - **CVE Search**: Looking up known vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database.
    - **Exploiting Misconfigurations**: Identifying weak passwords or default credentials.
    - **Using Exploit Databases**: Finding exploits in platforms like _Exploit-DB_ for discovered vulnerabilities.

---

### 5. **System Hacking**

- **Gaining Access**
    
    - **Cracking Passwords**: Brute-forcing or dictionary attacks using tools like _John the Ripper_ or _Hydra_.
    - **Exploitation**: Using an exploit from _Metasploit_ to gain access (e.g., exploiting EternalBlue for SMB).
- **Escalating Privileges**
    
    - **Examples**:
        - Exploiting _Sudo Misconfigurations_ on Linux to gain root.
        - Using _Mimikatz_ to extract plaintext passwords from memory in Windows.
- **Maintaining Access**
    
    - **Examples**:
        - Installing a backdoor like a web shell (e.g., _China Chopper_).
        - Creating a new admin account for persistence.
- **Clearing Logs**
    
    - **Examples**:
        - Using `wevtutil` on Windows to clear event logs.
        - Modifying or deleting logs in Linux using `shred` or editing log files.
